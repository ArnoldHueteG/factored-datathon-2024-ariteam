He succeeded Howard Schultz, the longtime Starbucks leader and chairman emeritus who came out of retirement in 2022 to serve as the company's interim CEO.\\n\\nBut investors quickly soured on Narasimhan as the company's sales weakened and it dealt with multiple issues, including competition from lower-cost competitors in China and boycotts in the Middle East and elsewhere due to its perceived support for Israel.\\n\\nMellody Hobson, the chair of Starbucks' board of directors, said Niccol has transformed Chipotle since becoming its CEO in 2018 by focusing on menu innovation, operational excellence and digital transformation.\\n\\n“Brian is a culture carrier who brings a wealth of experience and a proven track record of driving innovation and growth,\" Hobson said in a statement. “Like all of us at Starbucks, he understands that a remarkable customer experience is rooted in an exceptional partner experience.”\\n\\nSchultz said he has long admired Niccol.\\n\\n\"I believe he is the leader Starbucks needs at a pivotal moment in its history.

       "      <td>A hearse bearing the casket of Danilo Santos Romano rolled through the streets of Penha, a working class neighborhood of Sao Paulo’s east side, en route to the cemetery that lies beneath his apartment. Family members and friends walked behind the vehicle and dozens of shop owners who knew him as a regular customer gathered on the sidewalks to applaud as it passed. Romano was 35.\\n\\nSAO PAULO (AP) — The pilot of the plane that crashed down in Brazil last week was buried Monday in Sao Paulo, becoming the first person laid to rest among the 62 victims, as authorities continue working to determine what exactly caused the accident.\\n\\n“He had lived abroad, worked for foreign companies, but was always humble,\" Moura said. \"We used to chat about soccer, he really wanted to have a child to take to the stadium one day. Danilo was full of life.”\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nThe crash Friday killed 58 passengers and four crew members. Footage of the plane plunging while in a flat spin horrified people around the world, and the cause of the accident has yet to be determined. Some experts have pointed to the possibility of severe icing on the wings, which caused pilots to lose control of the plane, but airports minister Silvio Costa Filho told reporters Friday that Romano and his copilot made no calls for an emergency landing, nor did they communicate any adverse weather conditions.\\n\\nThey were flying the ATR 72 twin-engine turboprop for local airline Voepass, headed for the Guarulhos international airport, but the plane plunged from the sky in the nearby city of Vinhedo. Romano had just finished his first full year as commander for Voepass, which hired him as a copilot in November 2022, the airline told the AP in a statement. It added Romano had logged 5,202 hours flying for Voepass, all in ATRs. It is the only type of plane the company owns.\\n\\nRomano's widow, Thalita Valente Machado, didn’t speak to journalists gathered outside the ceremony, but provided a letter with a list of the people and organizations she wished to thank.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n“We want to give a very special thanks to his flight partner Humberto de Campos Alencar e Silva, who fought together with Danilo,\" her letter said. “We are sure they did everything possible and that they are heroes.”\\n\\nRomano’s burial followed a wake at a basilica Monday morning. One of the pilot’s heroes, the former goalkeeper for Brazil’s national soccer team and World Cup winner Marcos, was in attendance. Two of Romano’s friends told the AP that during the ceremony his 30-year-old widow repeatedly said “I lost a part of myself.”\\n\\nRomano's body was the first to be released by Sao Paulo's morgue after the crash. The morgue began receiving corpses Friday evening, and asked victims’ relatives to bring in medical, X-ray and dental records to help identify them. As of Monday evening, forensic experts had identified 17 bodies and returned eight to victims' relatives, Sao Paulo state's government said.\\n\\nMeanwhile in Cascavel, the city from which the doomed flight departed, more than a dozen families are awaiting the remains of their loved ones. Mayor Leonaldo Paranhos said on his social media channels that the city will make a conference center available should anyone wish to hold a collective wake in the space.\\n\\n“We are still waiting for information from Sao Paulo's morgue, which is still working to identify the bodies and communicate with the families,” Paranhos said. “Voepass will be responsible for sending the remains to their destinations.”\\n\\nAuthorities recovered both the plane’s “black boxes” — one with flight data and the other with cockpit audio — that are key to determining what exactly went awry. The air force’s center for the investigation and prevention of air accidents began analyzing them at its laboratory in the nation’s capital, Brasilia, and said it will issue a preliminary report within 30 days. Minister Costa Filho said the center was also opening a criminal probe.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nVoepass and French-Italian plane manufacturer ATR are collaborating with the investigations, they said in separate statements.</td>\n",

       "      <td>LOUISVILLE, Ky. (WDRB) -- A southern Indiana city is working on a program to prevent crime, and it's calling on the community to help.\\n\\nThe Madison Police Department is launching a Neighborhood Watch Program.\\n\\nWhile the overall concept isn't new, it is a new push for the small town.\\n\\n\"We've had some resemblance of a neighborhood watch program in the past. This is the most formal and kind of the largest structured community outreach effort that we've embarked on,\" said Madison Mayor Bob Courtney.\\n\\nCourtney said this effort is about partnerships with the community.\\n\\n\"We already have a very safe community and again, the communication is critical and it also helps our police officers just apply the resources where they need to be applied,\" he said.\\n\\nAccording to the Madison Police Department, the Neighborhood Watch Program encourages community engagement and collaboration with police and neighbors to prevent crime.\\n\\n\"It's important for us to have because it creates that connection between the citizens of Madison and the police department,\" said Madison Police Chief Shawn Scudder. \"A lot of times citizens feel disconnected or their voices aren't heard. This gives them an avenue to have direct contact with us when they have direct concerns.\"\\n\\nThrough the program, community members work together to monitor and report suspicious activities to police. The city has been divided into 12 neighborhoods for the Neighborhood Watch Program. Each one will be represented by what police are calling a \"Neighborhood Captain.\" That person will serve as the liaison between neighborhood members and the police department.\\n\\nScudder said each Neighborhood Captain will be chosen through a collaborative effort between members of the community and the police department.\\n\\n\"We want somebody who is going to be a good communicator. We can stay in touch with the neighborhood captain,\" he said.\\n\\nAccording to police, the captain will share information with the neighborhood watch members, create and maintain a neighborhood watch phone tree, and create a neighborhood watch Facebook group.\\n\\nThe first meeting is scheduled for Aug. 19. Each of the 12 neighborhoods has a different meeting time and location. For a list of locations, click here.\\n\\nTo view a map of the neighborhoods, click here.\\n\\nWatch members are asked to serve as the \"eyes and ears\" of their neighborhoods.\\n\\n\"Public safety is a key initiative for the city. It's the largest resource that we budget for throughout the year,\" Courtney said.\\n\\nAccording to Scudder, the Madison Police Department is about three or four officers short from being fully staffed with 35 officers. While the city hasn't seen an increase in crime, Scudder said this new program is a way for police to be more transparent and connect with the community.\\n\\n\"This will just help us identify problems easier so that we can be in the neighborhoods that we need to be in,\" Scudder said.\\n\\nThe program's goal is to have police more present in areas of need.\\n\\nMore Stories From Madison, Indiana:\\n\\nCopyright 2024 WDRB Media.

       "      <td>The leadership political action committee of Republican Bill Johnson, who left Congress on Jan. 21 to become Youngstown State University president, gave approximately $7,242 in July to a booster organization that helps support the school’s student-athletes.\\n\\nBelief in Life and Liberty PAC (Bill’s PAC) gave the Penguin Club a $2,000 donation on July 24 and then a $5,242 donation a day later, according to its Monday monthly filing with the Federal Election Commission.\\n\\nIn late June, Johnson moved the $873,721 he had left in his congressional account — and closed that fund — to a PAC that existed for less than three weeks and then finally to his leadership PAC.\\n\\nShortly after that, Johnson said he wanted to use some of the remaining money to benefit YSU.\\n\\nJohnson gave $1,000 to the Penguin Club on Jan. 26, five days after he started as YSU president.\\n\\nThe Penguin Club is a booster organization that supports YSU student-athletes participating in 21 Division I sports, providing scholarships and grants for tuition, books, room and board, according to the website of the university’s athletics department.\\n\\nGiving the money directly to the university is likely not permissible under FEC laws.\\n\\nJohnson is permitted to make an unlimited financial transfer to any national, state or local political party.\\n\\nJohnson said last month that he is undecided if he was going to give money to candidates.\\n\\nHeading into July, his PAC had $875,330.46.\\n\\nDuring the month of July, Bill’s PAC made $2,210 in interest and spent $12,228. In addition to the Penguin Club donations, the PAC spent $2,739.83 on compliance services and $2,175 on software in July.\\n\\nIt had $865,312.04 in the fund as of July 31.\\n\\nBill’s PAC notified the FEC on Jan. 15 that it was going to file monthly after reporting quarterly. The filing deadline for this latest report is Aug. 20, but Johnson’s PAC filed eight days early.\\n\\nLeadership PACs are established by members of Congress and other political leaders to support candidates for federal and nonfederal offices, according to the FEC.\\n\\nJohnson represented the 6th Congressional District for 13 years before his Jan. 21 resignation to become YSU president.\\n\\nWhen Johnson was planning to run for reelection before his YSU hire, his committee raised $860,848 and spent $1,047,891 in 2023.\\n\\nBecause of a large surplus from previous campaigns, he ended 2023 with a near $1 million surplus in his fund. It would have been even more but Johnson gave a $235,000 contribution on Nov. 29 to the National Republican Congressional Committee as part of an overall spending amount of $402,583.28 during 2023’s fourth quarter.\\n\\nJohnson also closed the Johnson Leads Committee on Feb. 15. That was a joint fundraising committee formed by Johnson’s now-closed campaign committee, Bill’s PAC and the National Republican Congressional Committee.\\n\\nRepublican Michael Rulli of Salem won a June 11 special election for Johnson’s unexpired term. Rulli resigned his state senator position the day after the election and was sworn in June 25 to the U.S. House.\\n\\nRulli will run Nov. 5 against Democratic Michael L. Kripchak of Youngstown, who he defeated by 9.7% in the June 11 special election, for a full two-year term in the Nov. 5 general election.\\n\\nThe 6th Congressional District includes all of Mahoning, Columbiana, Carroll, Jefferson, Belmont, Harrison, Monroe, Noble and Washington counties and portions of Stark and Tuscarawas counties.</td>\n",

(AP Photo/Charles Krupa, File)\\n\\nStarbucks, struggling with weak demand and disgruntled investors, said Tuesday that CEO Laxman Narasimhan is stepping down after a little more than a year in the job.\\n\\nThe Seattle coffee giant said Brian Niccol, the chairman and CEO of Chipotle, will become Starbucks' chairman and CEO on Sept. 9.\\n\\nStarbucks shares jumped more than 13% before the market opened.\\n\\nNarasimhan, a longtime PepsiCo executive who has also served as the CEO of Reckitt, a U.K.-based consumer health company, became Starbucks' CEO in March 2023. He succeeded Howard Schultz, the longtime Starbucks leader and chairman emeritus who came out of retirement in 2022 to serve as the company's interim CEO.\\n\\nBut investors quickly soured on Narasimhan as the company's sales weakened and it dealt with multiple issues, including competition from lower-cost competitors in China and boycotts in the Middle East and elsewhere due to its perceived support for Israel.\\n\\nMellody Hobson, the chair of Starbucks' board of directors, said Niccol has transformed Chipotle since becoming its CEO in 2018 by focusing on menu innovation, operational excellence and digital transformation.\\n\\n“Brian is a culture carrier who brings a wealth of experience and a proven track record of driving innovation and growth,\" Hobson said in a statement. “Like all of us at Starbucks, he understands that a remarkable customer experience is rooted in an exceptional partner experience.”\\n\\nSchultz said he has long admired Niccol.\\n\\n\"I believe he is the leader Starbucks needs at a pivotal moment in its history.

       "1  A hearse bearing the casket of Danilo Santos Romano rolled through the streets of Penha, a working class neighborhood of Sao Paulo’s east side, en route to the cemetery that lies beneath his apartment. Family members and friends walked behind the vehicle and dozens of shop owners who knew him as a regular customer gathered on the sidewalks to applaud as it passed. Romano was 35.\\n\\nSAO PAULO (AP) — The pilot of the plane that crashed down in Brazil last week was buried Monday in Sao Paulo, becoming the first person laid to rest among the 62 victims, as authorities continue working to determine what exactly caused the accident.\\n\\n“He had lived abroad, worked for foreign companies, but was always humble,\" Moura said. \"We used to chat about soccer, he really wanted to have a child to take to the stadium one day. Danilo was full of life.”\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nThe crash Friday killed 58 passengers and four crew members. Footage of the plane plunging while in a flat spin horrified people around the world, and the cause of the accident has yet to be determined. Some experts have pointed to the possibility of severe icing on the wings, which caused pilots to lose control of the plane, but airports minister Silvio Costa Filho told reporters Friday that Romano and his copilot made no calls for an emergency landing, nor did they communicate any adverse weather conditions.\\n\\nThey were flying the ATR 72 twin-engine turboprop for local airline Voepass, headed for the Guarulhos international airport, but the plane plunged from the sky in the nearby city of Vinhedo. Romano had just finished his first full year as commander for Voepass, which hired him as a copilot in November 2022, the airline told the AP in a statement. It added Romano had logged 5,202 hours flying for Voepass, all in ATRs. It is the only type of plane the company owns.\\n\\nRomano's widow, Thalita Valente Machado, didn’t speak to journalists gathered outside the ceremony, but provided a letter with a list of the people and organizations she wished to thank.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n“We want to give a very special thanks to his flight partner Humberto de Campos Alencar e Silva, who fought together with Danilo,\" her letter said. “We are sure they did everything possible and that they are heroes.”\\n\\nRomano’s burial followed a wake at a basilica Monday morning. One of the pilot’s heroes, the former goalkeeper for Brazil’s national soccer team and World Cup winner Marcos, was in attendance. Two of Romano’s friends told the AP that during the ceremony his 30-year-old widow repeatedly said “I lost a part of myself.”\\n\\nRomano's body was the first to be released by Sao Paulo's morgue after the crash. The morgue began receiving corpses Friday evening, and asked victims’ relatives to bring in medical, X-ray and dental records to help identify them. As of Monday evening, forensic experts had identified 17 bodies and returned eight to victims' relatives, Sao Paulo state's government said.\\n\\nMeanwhile in Cascavel, the city from which the doomed flight departed, more than a dozen families are awaiting the remains of their loved ones. Mayor Leonaldo Paranhos said on his social media channels that the city will make a conference center available should anyone wish to hold a collective wake in the space.\\n\\n“We are still waiting for information from Sao Paulo's morgue, which is still working to identify the bodies and communicate with the families,” Paranhos said. “Voepass will be responsible for sending the remains to their destinations.”\\n\\nAuthorities recovered both the plane’s “black boxes” — one with flight data and the other with cockpit audio — that are key to determining what exactly went awry.

(WDRB) -- A southern Indiana city is working on a program to prevent crime, and it's calling on the community to help.\\n\\nThe Madison Police Department is launching a Neighborhood Watch Program.\\n\\nWhile the overall concept isn't new, it is a new push for the small town.\\n\\n\"We've had some resemblance of a neighborhood watch program in the past. This is the most formal and kind of the largest structured community outreach effort that we've embarked on,\" said Madison Mayor Bob Courtney.\\n\\nCourtney said this effort is about partnerships with the community.\\n\\n\"We already have a very safe community and again, the communication is critical and it also helps our police officers just apply the resources where they need to be applied,\" he said.\\n\\nAccording to the Madison Police Department, the Neighborhood Watch Program encourages community engagement and collaboration with police and neighbors to prevent crime.\\n\\n\"It's important for us to have because it creates that connection between the citizens of Madison and the police department,\" said Madison Police Chief Shawn Scudder. \"A lot of times citizens feel disconnected or their voices aren't heard. This gives them an avenue to have direct contact with us when they have direct concerns.\"\\n\\nThrough the program, community members work together to monitor and report suspicious activities to police. The city has been divided into 12 neighborhoods for the Neighborhood Watch Program. Each one will be represented by what police are calling a \"Neighborhood Captain.\" That person will serve as the liaison between neighborhood members and the police department.\\n\\nScudder said each Neighborhood Captain will be chosen through a collaborative effort between members of the community and the police department.\\n\\n\"We want somebody who is going to be a good communicator. We can stay in touch with the neighborhood captain,\" he said.\\n\\nAccording to police, the captain will share information with the neighborhood watch members, create and maintain a neighborhood watch phone tree, and create a neighborhood watch Facebook group.\\n\\nThe first meeting is scheduled for Aug. 19. Each of the 12 neighborhoods has a different meeting time and location.

It's the largest resource that we budget for throughout the year,\" Courtney said.\\n\\nAccording to Scudder, the Madison Police Department is about three or four officers short from being fully staffed with 35 officers. While the city hasn't seen an increase in crime, Scudder said this new program is a way for police to be more transparent and connect with the community.\\n\\n\"This will just help us identify problems easier so that we can be in the neighborhoods that we need to be in,\" Scudder said.\\n\\nThe program's goal is to have police more present in areas of need.\\n\\nMore Stories From Madison, Indiana:\\n\\nCopyright 2024 WDRB Media.

They underscored the significance of continuous collaboration to maintain a positive trajectory in bilateral relations and explore new areas of engagement.\\n\\nWhile discussing parliamentary cooperation, the speaker emphasised regular interaction between parliaments, mainly through parliamentary friendship groups and the exchange of parliamentary delegations, in order to share and learn from each other’s experiences.\\n\\nThe ambassador expressed gratitude to the speaker for his kind remarks and reiterated that Belarus views Pakistan as an important regional stakeholder. He expressed a desire to further strengthen linkages in all areas of mutual interest, in addition to fostering parliamentary and cultural exchanges.\\n\\nCopyright Business Recorder, 2024  \n",

In addition to the Penguin Club donations, the PAC spent $2,739.83 on compliance services and $2,175 on software in July.\\n\\nIt had $865,312.04 in the fund as of July 31.\\n\\nBill’s PAC notified the FEC on Jan. 15 that it was going to file monthly after reporting quarterly. The filing deadline for this latest report is Aug. 20, but Johnson’s PAC filed eight days early.\\n\\nLeadership PACs are established by members of Congress and other political leaders to support candidates for federal and nonfederal offices, according to the FEC.\\n\\nJohnson represented the 6th Congressional District for 13 years before his Jan. 21 resignation to become YSU president.\\n\\nWhen Johnson was planning to run for reelection before his YSU hire, his committee raised $860,848 and spent $1,047,891 in 2023.\\n\\nBecause of a large surplus from previous campaigns, he ended 2023 with a near $1 million surplus in his fund. It would have been even more but Johnson gave a $235,000 contribution on Nov. 29 to the National Republican Congressional Committee as part of an overall spending amount of $402,583.28 during 2023’s fourth quarter.\\n\\nJohnson also closed the Johnson Leads Committee on Feb. 15. That was a joint fundraising committee formed by Johnson’s now-closed campaign committee, Bill’s PAC and the National Republican Congressional Committee.\\n\\nRepublican Michael Rulli of Salem won a June 11 special election for Johnson’s unexpired term. Rulli resigned his state senator position the day after the election and was sworn in June 25 to the U.S. House.\\n\\nRulli will run Nov. 5 against Democratic Michael L. Kripchak of Youngstown, who he defeated by 9.7% in the June 11 special election, for a full two-year term in the Nov. 5 general election.\\n\\nThe 6th Congressional District includes all of Mahoning, Columbiana, Carroll, Jefferson, Belmont, Harrison, Monroe, Noble and Washington counties and portions of Stark and Tuscarawas counties.

       "      <td>A hearse bearing the casket of Danilo Santos Romano rolled through the streets of Penha, a working class neighborhood of Sao Paulo’s east side, en route to the cemetery that lies beneath his apartment. Family members and friends walked behind the vehicle and dozens of shop owners who knew him as a regular customer gathered on the sidewalks to applaud as it passed. Romano was 35.\\n\\nSAO PAULO (AP) — The pilot of the plane that crashed down in Brazil last week was buried Monday in Sao Paulo, becoming the first person laid to rest among the 62 victims, as authorities continue working to determine what exactly caused the accident.\\n\\n“He had lived abroad, worked for foreign companies, but was always humble,\" Moura said. \"We used to chat about soccer, he really wanted to have a child to take to the stadium one day. Danilo was full of life.”\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nThe crash Friday killed 58 passengers and four crew members. Footage of the plane plunging while in a flat spin horrified people around the world, and the cause of the accident has yet to be determined. Some experts have pointed to the possibility of severe icing on the wings, which caused pilots to lose control of the plane, but airports minister Silvio Costa Filho told reporters Friday that Romano and his copilot made no calls for an emergency landing, nor did they communicate any adverse weather conditions.\\n\\nThey were flying the ATR 72 twin-engine turboprop for local airline Voepass, headed for the Guarulhos international airport, but the plane plunged from the sky in the nearby city of Vinhedo. Romano had just finished his first full year as commander for Voepass, which hired him as a copilot in November 2022, the airline told the AP in a statement. It added Romano had logged 5,202 hours flying for Voepass, all in ATRs. It is the only type of plane the company owns.\\n\\nRomano's widow, Thalita Valente Machado, didn’t speak to journalists gathered outside the ceremony, but provided a letter with a list of the people and organizations she wished to thank.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n“We want to give a very special thanks to his flight partner Humberto de Campos Alencar e Silva, who fought together with Danilo,\" her letter said. “We are sure they did everything possible and that they are heroes.”\\n\\nRomano’s burial followed a wake at a basilica Monday morning. One of the pilot’s heroes, the former goalkeeper for Brazil’s national soccer team and World Cup winner Marcos, was in attendance. Two of Romano’s friends told the AP that during the ceremony his 30-year-old widow repeatedly said “I lost a part of myself.”\\n\\nRomano's body was the first to be released by Sao Paulo's morgue after the crash. The morgue began receiving corpses Friday evening, and asked victims’ relatives to bring in medical, X-ray and dental records to help identify them. As of Monday evening, forensic experts had identified 17 bodies and returned eight to victims' relatives, Sao Paulo state's government said.\\n\\nMeanwhile in Cascavel, the city from which the doomed flight departed, more than a dozen families are awaiting the remains of their loved ones. Mayor Leonaldo Paranhos said on his social media channels that the city will make a conference center available should anyone wish to hold a collective wake in the space.\\n\\n“We are still waiting for information from Sao Paulo's morgue, which is still working to identify the bodies and communicate with the families,” Paranhos said. “Voepass will be responsible for sending the remains to their destinations.”\\n\\nAuthorities recovered both the plane’s “black boxes” — one with flight data and the other with cockpit audio — that are key to determining what exactly went awry. The air force’s center for the investigation and prevention of air accidents began analyzing them at its laboratory in the nation’s capital, Brasilia, and said it will issue a preliminary report within 30 days. Minister Costa Filho said the center was also opening a criminal probe.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nVoepass and French-Italian plane manufacturer ATR are collaborating with the investigations, they said in separate statements.</td>\n",
       "      <td>Danilo Santos Romano, the pilot who tragically died in a plane crash in Brazil, was buried in São Paulo, with family, friends, and community members mourning his loss. Romano, 35, was laid to rest as the first of the 62 victims of the crash, which occurred while he was piloting a flight for local airline Voepass. The cause of the crash remains under investigation, with initial theories suggesting severe icing on the wings, although the pilots made no distress calls. Authorities are analyzing the plane's black boxes as part of their inquiry, and a criminal probe has been initiated. As families await news of their loved ones, a community wake is being organized in Cascavel for those who wish to honor the victims collectively.</td>\n",

       "      <td>LOUISVILLE, Ky. (WDRB) -- A southern Indiana city is working on a program to prevent crime, and it's calling on the community to help.\\n\\nThe Madison Police Department is launching a Neighborhood Watch Program.\\n\\nWhile the overall concept isn't new, it is a new push for the small town.\\n\\n\"We've had some resemblance of a neighborhood watch program in the past. This is the most formal and kind of the largest structured community outreach effort that we've embarked on,\" said Madison Mayor Bob Courtney.\\n\\nCourtney said this effort is about partnerships with the community.\\n\\n\"We already have a very safe community and again, the communication is critical and it also helps our police officers just apply the resources where they need to be applied,\" he said.\\n\\nAccording to the Madison Police Department, the Neighborhood Watch Program encourages community engagement and collaboration with police and neighbors to prevent crime.\\n\\n\"It's important for us to have because it creates that connection between the citizens of Madison and the police department,\" said Madison Police Chief Shawn Scudder. \"A lot of times citizens feel disconnected or their voices aren't heard. This gives them an avenue to have direct contact with us when they have direct concerns.\"\\n\\nThrough the program, community members work together to monitor and report suspicious activities to police. The city has been divided into 12 neighborhoods for the Neighborhood Watch Program. Each one will be represented by what police are calling a \"Neighborhood Captain.\" That person will serve as the liaison between neighborhood members and the police department.\\n\\nScudder said each Neighborhood Captain will be chosen through a collaborative effort between members of the community and the police department.\\n\\n\"We want somebody who is going to be a good communicator. We can stay in touch with the neighborhood captain,\" he said.\\n\\nAccording to police, the captain will share information with the neighborhood watch members, create and maintain a neighborhood watch phone tree, and create a neighborhood watch Facebook group.\\n\\nThe first meeting is scheduled for Aug. 19. Each of the 12 neighborhoods has a different meeting time and location. For a list of locations, click here.\\n\\nTo view a map of the neighborhoods, click here.\\n\\nWatch members are asked to serve as the \"eyes and ears\" of their neighborhoods.\\n\\n\"Public safety is a key initiative for the city. It's the largest resource that we budget for throughout the year,\" Courtney said.\\n\\nAccording to Scudder, the Madison Police Department is about three or four officers short from being fully staffed with 35 officers. While the city hasn't seen an increase in crime, Scudder said this new program is a way for police to be more transparent and connect with the community.\\n\\n\"This will just help us identify problems easier so that we can be in the neighborhoods that we need to be in,\" Scudder said.\\n\\nThe program's goal is to have police more present in areas of need.\\n\\nMore Stories From Madison, Indiana:\\n\\nCopyright 2024 WDRB Media.

(AP Photo/Charles Krupa, File)\\n\\nStarbucks, struggling with weak demand and disgruntled investors, said Tuesday that CEO Laxman Narasimhan is stepping down after a little more than a year in the job.\\n\\nThe Seattle coffee giant said Brian Niccol, the chairman and CEO of Chipotle, will become Starbucks' chairman and CEO on Sept. 9.\\n\\nStarbucks shares jumped more than 13% before the market opened.\\n\\nNarasimhan, a longtime PepsiCo executive who has also served as the CEO of Reckitt, a U.K.-based consumer health company, became Starbucks' CEO in March 2023. He succeeded Howard Schultz, the longtime Starbucks leader and chairman emeritus who came out of retirement in 2022 to serve as the company's interim CEO.\\n\\nBut investors quickly soured on Narasimhan as the company's sales weakened and it dealt with multiple issues, including competition from lower-cost competitors in China and boycotts in the Middle East and elsewhere due to its perceived support for Israel.\\n\\nMellody Hobson, the chair of Starbucks' board of directors, said Niccol has transformed Chipotle since becoming its CEO in 2018 by focusing on menu innovation, operational excellence and digital transformation.\\n\\n“Brian is a culture carrier who brings a wealth of experience and a proven track record of driving innovation and growth,\" Hobson said in a statement. “Like all of us at Starbucks, he understands that a remarkable customer experience is rooted in an exceptional partner experience.”\\n\\nSchultz said he has long admired Niccol.\\n\\n\"I believe he is the leader Starbucks needs at a pivotal moment in its history.

       "1  A hearse bearing the casket of Danilo Santos Romano rolled through the streets of Penha, a working class neighborhood of Sao Paulo’s east side, en route to the cemetery that lies beneath his apartment. Family members and friends walked behind the vehicle and dozens of shop owners who knew him as a regular customer gathered on the sidewalks to applaud as it passed. Romano was 35.\\n\\nSAO PAULO (AP) — The pilot of the plane that crashed down in Brazil last week was buried Monday in Sao Paulo, becoming the first person laid to rest among the 62 victims, as authorities continue working to determine what exactly caused the accident.\\n\\n“He had lived abroad, worked for foreign companies, but was always humble,\" Moura said. \"We used to chat about soccer, he really wanted to have a child to take to the stadium one day. Danilo was full of life.”\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nThe crash Friday killed 58 passengers and four crew members. Footage of the plane plunging while in a flat spin horrified people around the world, and the cause of the accident has yet to be determined. Some experts have pointed to the possibility of severe icing on the wings, which caused pilots to lose control of the plane, but airports minister Silvio Costa Filho told reporters Friday that Romano and his copilot made no calls for an emergency landing, nor did they communicate any adverse weather conditions.\\n\\nThey were flying the ATR 72 twin-engine turboprop for local airline Voepass, headed for the Guarulhos international airport, but the plane plunged from the sky in the nearby city of Vinhedo. Romano had just finished his first full year as commander for Voepass, which hired him as a copilot in November 2022, the airline told the AP in a statement. It added Romano had logged 5,202 hours flying for Voepass, all in ATRs. It is the only type of plane the company owns.\\n\\nRomano's widow, Thalita Valente Machado, didn’t speak to journalists gathered outside the ceremony, but provided a letter with a list of the people and organizations she wished to thank.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n“We want to give a very special thanks to his flight partner Humberto de Campos Alencar e Silva, who fought together with Danilo,\" her letter said. “We are sure they did everything possible and that they are heroes.”\\n\\nRomano’s burial followed a wake at a basilica Monday morning. One of the pilot’s heroes, the former goalkeeper for Brazil’s national soccer team and World Cup winner Marcos, was in attendance. Two of Romano’s friends told the AP that during the ceremony his 30-year-old widow repeatedly said “I lost a part of myself.”\\n\\nRomano's body was the first to be released by Sao Paulo's morgue after the crash. The morgue began receiving corpses Friday evening, and asked victims’ relatives to bring in medical, X-ray and dental records to help identify them. As of Monday evening, forensic experts had identified 17 bodies and returned eight to victims' relatives, Sao Paulo state's government said.\\n\\nMeanwhile in Cascavel, the city from which the doomed flight departed, more than a dozen families are awaiting the remains of their loved ones. Mayor Leonaldo Paranhos said on his social media channels that the city will make a conference center available should anyone wish to hold a collective wake in the space.\\n\\n“We are still waiting for information from Sao Paulo's morgue, which is still working to identify the bodies and communicate with the families,” Paranhos said. “Voepass will be responsible for sending the remains to their destinations.”\\n\\nAuthorities recovered both the plane’s “black boxes” — one with flight data and the other with cockpit audio — that are key to determining what exactly went awry.

(WDRB) -- A southern Indiana city is working on a program to prevent crime, and it's calling on the community to help.\\n\\nThe Madison Police Department is launching a Neighborhood Watch Program.\\n\\nWhile the overall concept isn't new, it is a new push for the small town.\\n\\n\"We've had some resemblance of a neighborhood watch program in the past. This is the most formal and kind of the largest structured community outreach effort that we've embarked on,\" said Madison Mayor Bob Courtney.\\n\\nCourtney said this effort is about partnerships with the community.\\n\\n\"We already have a very safe community and again, the communication is critical and it also helps our police officers just apply the resources where they need to be applied,\" he said.\\n\\nAccording to the Madison Police Department, the Neighborhood Watch Program encourages community engagement and collaboration with police and neighbors to prevent crime.\\n\\n\"It's important for us to have because it creates that connection between the citizens of Madison and the police department,\" said Madison Police Chief Shawn Scudder. \"A lot of times citizens feel disconnected or their voices aren't heard. This gives them an avenue to have direct contact with us when they have direct concerns.\"\\n\\nThrough the program, community members work together to monitor and report suspicious activities to police. The city has been divided into 12 neighborhoods for the Neighborhood Watch Program. Each one will be represented by what police are calling a \"Neighborhood Captain.\" That person will serve as the liaison between neighborhood members and the police department.\\n\\nScudder said each Neighborhood Captain will be chosen through a collaborative effort between members of the community and the police department.\\n\\n\"We want somebody who is going to be a good communicator. We can stay in touch with the neighborhood captain,\" he said.\\n\\nAccording to police, the captain will share information with the neighborhood watch members, create and maintain a neighborhood watch phone tree, and create a neighborhood watch Facebook group.\\n\\nThe first meeting is scheduled for Aug. 19. Each of the 12 neighborhoods has a different meeting time and location.

It's the largest resource that we budget for throughout the year,\" Courtney said.\\n\\nAccording to Scudder, the Madison Police Department is about three or four officers short from being fully staffed with 35 officers. While the city hasn't seen an increase in crime, Scudder said this new program is a way for police to be more transparent and connect with the community.\\n\\n\"This will just help us identify problems easier so that we can be in the neighborhoods that we need to be in,\" Scudder said.\\n\\nThe program's goal is to have police more present in areas of need.\\n\\nMore Stories From Madison, Indiana:\\n\\nCopyright 2024 WDRB Media.

In addition to the Penguin Club donations, the PAC spent $2,739.83 on compliance services and $2,175 on software in July.\\n\\nIt had $865,312.04 in the fund as of July 31.\\n\\nBill’s PAC notified the FEC on Jan. 15 that it was going to file monthly after reporting quarterly. The filing deadline for this latest report is Aug. 20, but Johnson’s PAC filed eight days early.\\n\\nLeadership PACs are established by members of Congress and other political leaders to support candidates for federal and nonfederal offices, according to the FEC.\\n\\nJohnson represented the 6th Congressional District for 13 years before his Jan. 21 resignation to become YSU president.\\n\\nWhen Johnson was planning to run for reelection before his YSU hire, his committee raised $860,848 and spent $1,047,891 in 2023.\\n\\nBecause of a large surplus from previous campaigns, he ended 2023 with a near $1 million surplus in his fund. It would have been even more but Johnson gave a $235,000 contribution on Nov. 29 to the National Republican Congressional Committee as part of an overall spending amount of $402,583.28 during 2023’s fourth quarter.\\n\\nJohnson also closed the Johnson Leads Committee on Feb. 15. That was a joint fundraising committee formed by Johnson’s now-closed campaign committee, Bill’s PAC and the National Republican Congressional Committee.\\n\\nRepublican Michael Rulli of Salem won a June 11 special election for Johnson’s unexpired term. Rulli resigned his state senator position the day after the election and was sworn in June 25 to the U.S. House.\\n\\nRulli will run Nov. 5 against Democratic Michael L. Kripchak of Youngstown, who he defeated by 9.7% in the June 11 special election, for a full two-year term in the Nov. 5 general election.\\n\\nThe 6th Congressional District includes all of Mahoning, Columbiana, Carroll, Jefferson, Belmont, Harrison, Monroe, Noble and Washington counties and portions of Stark and Tuscarawas counties.   \n",

Effective September 9, Brian Niccol, the current CEO of Chipotle, will take over as chairman and CEO of Starbucks. Narasimhan's tenure was marked by declining sales and increased competition, leading to a negative investor sentiment. Niccol is expected to bring innovation and strategic growth to Starbucks, with support from former CEO Howard Schultz. Following the announcement, Starbucks shares rose over 13%.  \n",

Family members and friends walked behind the vehicle and dozens of shop owners who knew him as a regular customer gathered on the sidewalks to applaud as it passed. Romano was 35.\\n\\nSAO PAULO (AP) — The pilot of the plane that crashed down in Brazil last week was buried Monday in Sao Paulo, becoming the first person laid to rest among the 62 victims, as authorities continue working to determine what exactly caused the accident.\\n\\n“He had lived abroad, worked for foreign companies, but was always humble,\" Moura said. \"We used to chat about soccer, he really wanted to have a child to take to the stadium one day. Danilo was full of life.”\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nThe crash Friday killed 58 passengers and four crew members. Footage of the plane plunging while in a flat spin horrified people around the world, and the cause of the accident has yet to be determined. Some experts have pointed to the possibility of severe icing on the wings, which caused pilots to lose control of the plane, but airports minister Silvio Costa Filho told reporters Friday that Romano and his copilot made no calls for an emergency landing, nor did they communicate any adverse weather conditions.\\n\\nThey were flying the ATR 72 twin-engine turboprop for local airline Voepass, headed for the Guarulhos international airport, but the plane plunged from the sky in the nearby city of Vinhedo. Romano had just finished his first full year as commander for Voepass, which hired him as a copilot in November 2022, the airline told the AP in a statement. It added Romano had logged 5,202 hours flying for Voepass, all in ATRs. It is the only type of plane the company owns.\\n\\nRomano's widow, Thalita Valente Machado, didn’t speak to journalists gathered outside the ceremony, but provided a letter with a list of the people and organizations she wished to thank.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n“We want to give a very special thanks to his flight partner Humberto de Campos Alencar e Silva, who fought together with Danilo,\" her letter said. “We are sure they did everything possible and that they are heroes.”\\n\\nRomano’s burial followed a wake at a basilica Monday morning. One of the pilot’s heroes, the former goalkeeper for Brazil’s national soccer team and World Cup winner Marcos, was in attendance. Two of Romano’s friends told the AP that during the ceremony his 30-year-old widow repeatedly said “I lost a part of myself.”\\n\\nRomano's body was the first to be released by Sao Paulo's morgue after the crash. The morgue began receiving corpses Friday evening, and asked victims’ relatives to bring in medical, X-ray and dental records to help identify them. As of Monday evening, forensic experts had identified 17 bodies and returned eight to victims' relatives, Sao Paulo state's government said.\\n\\nMeanwhile in Cascavel, the city from which the doomed flight departed, more than a dozen families are awaiting the remains of their loved ones. Mayor Leonaldo Paranhos said on his social media channels that the city will make a conference center available should anyone wish to hold a collective wake in the space.\\n\\n“We are still waiting for information from Sao Paulo's morgue, which is still working to identify the bodies and communicate with the families,” Paranhos said. “Voepass will be responsible for sending the remains to their destinations.”\\n\\nAuthorities recovered both the plane’s “black boxes” — one with flight data and the other with cockpit audio — that are key to determining what exactly went awry. The air force’s center for the investigation and prevention of air accidents began analyzing them at its laboratory in the nation’s capital, Brasilia, and said it will issue a preliminary report within 30 days. Minister Costa Filho said the center was also opening a criminal probe.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nVoepass and French-Italian plane manufacturer ATR are collaborating with the investigations, they said in separate statements.</td>\n",

This is the most formal and kind of the largest structured community outreach effort that we've embarked on,\" said Madison Mayor Bob Courtney.\\n\\nCourtney said this effort is about partnerships with the community.\\n\\n\"We already have a very safe community and again, the communication is critical and it also helps our police officers just apply the resources where they need to be applied,\" he said.\\n\\nAccording to the Madison Police Department, the Neighborhood Watch Program encourages community engagement and collaboration with police and neighbors to prevent crime.\\n\\n\"It's important for us to have because it creates that connection between the citizens of Madison and the police department,\" said Madison Police Chief Shawn Scudder. \"A lot of times citizens feel disconnected or their voices aren't heard. This gives them an avenue to have direct contact with us when they have direct concerns.\"\\n\\nThrough the program, community members work together to monitor and report suspicious activities to police. The city has been divided into 12 neighborhoods for the Neighborhood Watch Program. Each one will be represented by what police are calling a \"Neighborhood Captain.\" That person will serve as the liaison between neighborhood members and the police department.\\n\\nScudder said each Neighborhood Captain will be chosen through a collaborative effort between members of the community and the police department.\\n\\n\"We want somebody who is going to be a good communicator. We can stay in touch with the neighborhood captain,\" he said.\\n\\nAccording to police, the captain will share information with the neighborhood watch members, create and maintain a neighborhood watch phone tree, and create a neighborhood watch Facebook group.\\n\\nThe first meeting is scheduled for Aug. 19. Each of the 12 neighborhoods has a different meeting time and location. For a list of locations, click here.\\n\\nTo view a map of the neighborhoods, click here.\\n\\nWatch members are asked to serve as the \"eyes and ears\" of their neighborhoods.\\n\\n\"Public safety is a key initiative for the city.

While the city hasn't seen an increase in crime, Scudder said this new program is a way for police to be more transparent and connect with the community.\\n\\n\"This will just help us identify problems easier so that we can be in the neighborhoods that we need to be in,\" Scudder said.\\n\\nThe program's goal is to have police more present in areas of need.\\n\\nMore Stories From Madison, Indiana:\\n\\nCopyright 2024 WDRB Media.

       "      <td>AUGUSTA, Maine — Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. no longer faces an attempt to disqualify him from the Maine ballot, after a challenger withdrew allegations of petition and residency issues.\\n\\nJames Stretch, whose experience in Democratic politics includes working for President Joe Biden’s campaign in 2020, informed Maine Secretary of State Shenna Bellows on Monday that he was withdrawing his challenge to Kennedy’s petition to appear on the November ballot. Bellows, a Democrat, dismissed the challenge Tuesday.\\n\\nStretch did not provide a reason for the withdrawal. His attorney did not immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday.\\n\\nThe withdrawal came amid a New York judge ruling Monday that Kennedy should not appear on that state’s ballot due to him living in California but falsely claiming on his petition to reside in New York. Stretch made a similar argument in his request to disqualify Kennedy here.\\n\\nBellows is still set to hear two separate challenges Thursday to independent candidate Cornel West’s candidacy.

       "      <td>(CNN) — Data from a retired NASA mission has revealed evidence of an underground reservoir of water deep beneath the surface of Mars, according to new research.\\n\\nA team of scientists estimates that there may be enough water, trapped in tiny cracks and pores of rock in the middle of the Martian crust, to fill oceans on the planet’s surface. The groundwater would likely cover the entirety of Mars to a depth of 1 mile (1.6 kilometers), the study found.\\n\\nThe data came from NASA’s InSight lander, which used a seismometer to study the interior of Mars from 2018 to 2022.\\n\\nFuture astronauts exploring Mars would encounter a whole host of challenges if they tried to access the water, because it’s located between 7 and 12 miles (11.5 and 20 kilometers) beneath the surface, according to the study published Monday in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\\n\\nBut the finding uncovers new details about the geological history of Mars — and suggests a new place to search for life on the red planet if the water could ever be accessed.\\n\\n“Understanding the Martian water cycle is critical for understanding the evolution of the climate, surface and interior,” said lead study author Vashan Wright, assistant professor and geophysicist at the University of California, San Diego’s Scripps Institution of Oceanography, in a statement. “A useful starting point is to identify where water is and how much is there.”\\n\\nThe search for ‘lost’ water on Mars\\n\\nMars was likely a warmer, wetter place billions of years ago, based on the evidence of ancient lakes, river channels, deltas and rocks altered by water studied by other NASA missions and observed by orbiters. But the red planet lost its atmosphere more than 3 billion years ago, which effectively ended the wet period on Mars.\\n\\nScientists still aren’t sure why Mars lost its atmosphere, and a multitude of missions have been developed to learn about the history of the planet’s water, where it went, and whether water ever created habitable conditions for life on Mars. While water remains trapped as ice at the planet’s polar ice caps, researchers don’t believe that can account for all the planet’s “lost” water.\\n\\nExisting theories offer a few likely scenarios for what happened to Martian water after Mars lost its atmosphere: Some hypothesize it became ice or was lost to space, while others suggest it was incorporated into minerals beneath the planet’s surface or trickled into deep aquifers.\\n\\nThe new findings suggest that water on Mars filtered down into the Martian crust.\\n\\nInSight, short for Interior Exploration using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport, was a stationary lander. But it collected unprecedented data about the thickness of the red planet’s crust and the temperature of its mantle, as well as the depth and composition of the core and atmosphere. The lander’s seismometer detected the first quakes on another planet, dubbed marsquakes.\\n\\nWhile earthquakes occur when tectonic plates shift, move and grind against one another, the Martian crust is like one giant plate with faults and fractures as the planet continues to shrink and cool over time. As the Martian crust stretches, it cracks, and InSight’s seismometer was able to detect more than 1,300 marsquakes as they rumbled from hundreds and thousands of miles away.\\n\\nScientists studying InSight’s data were able to study the speed of marsquakes as they traveled through the planet, which can serve as an indicator of what substances exist beneath the Martian surface.\\n\\nThe speed of seismic waves depends on what the rock is made of, where it has cracks and what fills those cracks, Wright said.\\n\\nThe team used this data and fed it into a mathematical model of rock physics, which is used on Earth to map underground oil fields and aquifers.\\n\\nThe results showed that InSight’s data best matches up with a deep layer of igneous, or volcanic, rock that is filled with liquid water.\\n\\n“Establishing that there is a big reservoir of liquid water provides some window into what the climate was like or could be like,” said study coauthor Michael Manga, a professor of earth and planetary science at the University of California, Berkeley, in a statement.\\n\\n“And water is necessary for life as we know it. I don’t see why (the underground reservoir) is not a habitable environment,” Manga added. “It’s certainly true on Earth — deep, deep mines host life, the bottom of the ocean hosts life. We haven’t found any evidence for life on Mars, but at least we have identified a place that should, in principle, be able to sustain life.”\\n\\nIf Mars’ crust is similar across the planet, there may be more water within the mid-crust zone than the “volumes proposed to have filled hypothesized ancient Martian oceans,” the authors wrote in the study.\\n\\nRocks help trap information about the history of a planet, and understanding the water cycle of a planet can help researchers unlock the evolution of Mars, Wright said.\\n\\nWhile the analysis of the data can’t reveal any information about life, past or present, if it existed on Mars, it’s possible that wet Martian crust could be habitable in the same way that deep groundwater on Earth is hospitable for microbial life, he said.\\n\\nBut even drilling holes just half a mile (1 kilometer) or deeper on Earth is a challenge that requires energy and infrastructure, so a massive number of resources would need to be brought to Mars to drill to such depths, Wright said.\\n\\nThe team was surprised not to find evidence suggesting a layer of frozen groundwater beneath Insight because that portion of the crust is cold. The researchers are still trying to determine why there isn’t frozen groundwater at shallower depths above the mid-crust.\\n\\nWindows into Martian history\\n\\nThe findings add a new piece to the Martian water puzzle.\\n\\nThe idea that liquid water may exist deep beneath the Martian surface has been around for decades, but this is the first time real data from a Mars mission can confirm such speculation, said Alberto Fairén, a visiting interdisciplinary planetary scientist and astrobiologist within the department of astronomy at Cornell University. Fairén was not involved in the study.\\n\\nHe said the water is likely “a kind of deep underground mud.”\\n\\n“These new results demonstrate that liquid water does exist in the Martian subsurface today, not in the form of discrete and isolated lakes, but as liquid water-saturated sediments, or aquifers,” Fairén said. “On Earth, the subsurface biosphere is truly vast, containing most of the prokaryotic diversity and biomass on our planet. Some investigations even point to an origin of life on Earth precisely deep in the subsurface. Therefore, the astrobiological implications of finally confirming the existence of liquid water habitats kilometers beneath the surface of Mars are truly exciting.”\\n\\nThe result is “exactly the kind of thing that I hoped we would get out of InSight,” said Bruce Banerdt, the principal investigator for the InSight mission.\\n\\n“I was hoping that we would get data that was good enough to do these kinds of studies where we’re actually looking at details of the inside of Mars that are relevant to geological questions, questions about the habitability of Mars, questions about the evolution of Mars,” he said.\\n\\nBanerdt, who was not involved in the research, said that while the interpretation of the data presented in the paper is strongly supported with good arguments, he also believes it is still somewhat speculative and that there is almost always another way to explain any given set of data.\\n\\n“I was really impressed by the fact that Wright et al brought in mineral physics concepts to interpret seismic data,” Banerdt said.\\n\\nBanerdt and Wright both expressed an interest in the ability to send more seismometers to Mars and other planets and moons within our solar system in the future. While InSight’s one seismometer gathered crucial data, spreading them out across Mars would reveal variations within the planet’s interior and provide a greater window into its diverse and complex history, Banerdt said.\\n\\n“Just as on Earth, where groundwater is connected to the surface through rivers and lakes, this was surely the case on early Mars as well,” Wright said. “The groundwater we see is a record of that past.”\\n\\nThe-CNN-Wire\\n\\n™ &amp; © 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

(AP Photo/Charles Krupa, File)\\n\\nStarbucks, struggling with weak demand and disgruntled investors, said Tuesday that CEO Laxman Narasimhan is stepping down after a little more than a year in the job.\\n\\nThe Seattle coffee giant said Brian Niccol, the chairman and CEO of Chipotle, will become Starbucks' chairman and CEO on Sept. 9.\\n\\nStarbucks shares jumped more than 13% before the market opened.\\n\\nNarasimhan, a longtime PepsiCo executive who has also served as the CEO of Reckitt, a U.K.-based consumer health company, became Starbucks' CEO in March 2023. He succeeded Howard Schultz, the longtime Starbucks leader and chairman emeritus who came out of retirement in 2022 to serve as the company's interim CEO.\\n\\nBut investors quickly soured on Narasimhan as the company's sales weakened and it dealt with multiple issues, including competition from lower-cost competitors in China and boycotts in the Middle East and elsewhere due to its perceived support for Israel.\\n\\nMellody Hobson, the chair of Starbucks' board of directors, said Niccol has transformed Chipotle since becoming its CEO in 2018 by focusing on menu innovation, operational excellence and digital transformation.\\n\\n“Brian is a culture carrier who brings a wealth of experience and a proven track record of driving innovation and growth,\" Hobson said in a statement. “Like all of us at Starbucks, he understands that a remarkable customer experience is rooted in an exceptional partner experience.”\\n\\nSchultz said he has long admired Niccol.\\n\\n\"I believe he is the leader Starbucks needs at a pivotal moment in its history.

Family members and friends walked behind the vehicle and dozens of shop owners who knew him as a regular customer gathered on the sidewalks to applaud as it passed. Romano was 35.\\n\\nSAO PAULO (AP) — The pilot of the plane that crashed down in Brazil last week was buried Monday in Sao Paulo, becoming the first person laid to rest among the 62 victims, as authorities continue working to determine what exactly caused the accident.\\n\\n“He had lived abroad, worked for foreign companies, but was always humble,\" Moura said. \"We used to chat about soccer, he really wanted to have a child to take to the stadium one day. Danilo was full of life.”\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nThe crash Friday killed 58 passengers and four crew members. Footage of the plane plunging while in a flat spin horrified people around the world, and the cause of the accident has yet to be determined. Some experts have pointed to the possibility of severe icing on the wings, which caused pilots to lose control of the plane, but airports minister Silvio Costa Filho told reporters Friday that Romano and his copilot made no calls for an emergency landing, nor did they communicate any adverse weather conditions.\\n\\nThey were flying the ATR 72 twin-engine turboprop for local airline Voepass, headed for the Guarulhos international airport, but the plane plunged from the sky in the nearby city of Vinhedo. Romano had just finished his first full year as commander for Voepass, which hired him as a copilot in November 2022, the airline told the AP in a statement. It added Romano had logged 5,202 hours flying for Voepass, all in ATRs. It is the only type of plane the company owns.\\n\\nRomano's widow, Thalita Valente Machado, didn’t speak to journalists gathered outside the ceremony, but provided a letter with a list of the people and organizations she wished to thank.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n“We want to give a very special thanks to his flight partner Humberto de Campos Alencar e Silva, who fought together with Danilo,\" her letter said. “We are sure they did everything possible and that they are heroes.”\\n\\nRomano’s burial followed a wake at a basilica Monday morning. One of the pilot’s heroes, the former goalkeeper for Brazil’s national soccer team and World Cup winner Marcos, was in attendance. Two of Romano’s friends told the AP that during the ceremony his 30-year-old widow repeatedly said “I lost a part of myself.”\\n\\nRomano's body was the first to be released by Sao Paulo's morgue after the crash. The morgue began receiving corpses Friday evening, and asked victims’ relatives to bring in medical, X-ray and dental records to help identify them. As of Monday evening, forensic experts had identified 17 bodies and returned eight to victims' relatives, Sao Paulo state's government said.\\n\\nMeanwhile in Cascavel, the city from which the doomed flight departed, more than a dozen families are awaiting the remains of their loved ones. Mayor Leonaldo Paranhos said on his social media channels that the city will make a conference center available should anyone wish to hold a collective wake in the space.\\n\\n“We are still waiting for information from Sao Paulo's morgue, which is still working to identify the bodies and communicate with the families,” Paranhos said. “Voepass will be responsible for sending the remains to their destinations.”\\n\\nAuthorities recovered both the plane’s “black boxes” — one with flight data and the other with cockpit audio — that are key to determining what exactly went awry. The air force’s center for the investigation and prevention of air accidents began analyzing them at its laboratory in the nation’s capital, Brasilia, and said it will issue a preliminary report within 30 days. Minister Costa Filho said the center was also opening a criminal probe.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nVoepass and French-Italian plane manufacturer ATR are collaborating with the investigations, they said in separate statements.   \n",

      LOUISVILLE, Ky. (WDRB) -- A southern Indiana city is working on a program to prevent crime, and it's calling on the community to help.\\n\\nThe Madison Police Department is launching a Neighborhood Watch Program.\\n\\nWhile the overall concept isn't new, it is a new push for the small town.\\n\\n\"We've had some resemblance of a neighborhood watch program in the past. This is the most formal and kind of the largest structured community outreach effort that we've embarked on,\" said Madison Mayor Bob Courtney.\\n\\nCourtney said this effort is about partnerships with the community.\\n\\n\"We already have a very safe community and again, the communication is critical and it also helps our police officers just apply the resources where they need to be applied,\" he said.\\n\\nAccording to the Madison Police Department, the Neighborhood Watch Program encourages community engagement and collaboration with police and neighbors to prevent crime.\\n\\n\"It's important for us to have because it creates that connection between the citizens of Madison and the police department,\" said Madison Police Chief Shawn Scudder. \"A lot of times citizens feel disconnected or their voices aren't heard. This gives them an avenue to have direct contact with us when they have direct concerns.\"\\n\\nThrough the program, community members work together to monitor and report suspicious activities to police. The city has been divided into 12 neighborhoods for the Neighborhood Watch Program. Each one will be represented by what police are calling a \"Neighborhood Captain.\" That person will serve as the liaison between neighborhood members and the police department.\\n\\nScudder said each Neighborhood Captain will be chosen through a collaborative effort between members of the community and the police department.\\n\\n\"We want somebody who is going to be a good communicator. We can stay in touch with the neighborhood captain,\" he said.\\n\\nAccording to police, the captain will share information with the neighborhood watch members, create and maintain a neighborhood watch phone tree, and create a neighborhood watch Facebook group.\\n\\nThe first meeting is scheduled for Aug. 19. Each of the 12 neighborhoods has a different meeting time and location.

It's the largest resource that we budget for throughout the year,\" Courtney said.\\n\\nAccording to Scudder, the Madison Police Department is about three or four officers short from being fully staffed with 35 officers. While the city hasn't seen an increase in crime, Scudder said this new program is a way for police to be more transparent and connect with the community.\\n\\n\"This will just help us identify problems easier so that we can be in the neighborhoods that we need to be in,\" Scudder said.\\n\\nThe program's goal is to have police more present in areas of need.\\n\\nMore Stories From Madison, Indiana:\\n\\nCopyright 2024 WDRB Media.

                                  The leadership political action committee of Republican Bill Johnson, who left Congress on Jan. 21 to become Youngstown State University president, gave approximately $7,242 in July to a booster organization that helps support the school’s student-athletes.\\n\\nBelief in Life and Liberty PAC (Bill’s PAC) gave the Penguin Club a $2,000 donation on July 24 and then a $5,242 donation a day later, according to its Monday monthly filing with the Federal Election Commission.\\n\\nIn late June, Johnson moved the $873,721 he had left in his congressional account — and closed that fund — to a PAC that existed for less than three weeks and then finally to his leadership PAC.\\n\\nShortly after that, Johnson said he wanted to use some of the remaining money to benefit YSU.\\n\\nJohnson gave $1,000 to the Penguin Club on Jan. 26, five days after he started as YSU president.\\n\\nThe Penguin Club is a booster organization that supports YSU student-athletes participating in 21 Division I sports, providing scholarships and grants for tuition, books, room and board, according to the website of the university’s athletics department.\\n\\nGiving the money directly to the university is likely not permissible under FEC laws.\\n\\nJohnson is permitted to make an unlimited financial transfer to any national, state or local political party.\\n\\nJohnson said last month that he is undecided if he was going to give money to candidates.\\n\\nHeading into July, his PAC had $875,330.46.\\n\\nDuring the month of July, Bill’s PAC made $2,210 in interest and spent $12,228. In addition to the Penguin Club donations, the PAC spent $2,739.83 on compliance services and $2,175 on software in July.\\n\\nIt had $865,312.04 in the fund as of July 31.\\n\\nBill’s PAC notified the FEC on Jan. 15 that it was going to file monthly after reporting quarterly. The filing deadline for this latest report is Aug. 20, but Johnson’s PAC filed eight days early.\\n\\nLeadership PACs are established by members of Congress and other political leaders to support candidates for federal and nonfederal offices, according to the FEC.\\n\\nJohnson represented the 6th Congressional District for 13 years before his Jan. 21 resignation to become YSU president.\\n\\nWhen Johnson was planning to run for reelection before his YSU hire, his committee raised $860,848 and spent $1,047,891 in 2023.\\n\\nBecause of a large surplus from previous campaigns, he ended 2023 with a near $1 million surplus in his fund. It would have been even more but Johnson gave a $235,000 contribution on Nov. 29 to the National Republican Congressional Committee as part of an overall spending amount of $402,583.28 during 2023’s fourth quarter.\\n\\nJohnson also closed the Johnson Leads Committee on Feb. 15. That was a joint fundraising committee formed by Johnson’s now-closed campaign committee, Bill’s PAC and the National Republican Congressional Committee.\\n\\nRepublican Michael Rulli of Salem won a June 11 special election for Johnson’s unexpired term. Rulli resigned his state senator position the day after the election and was sworn in June 25 to the U.S. House.\\n\\nRulli will run Nov. 5 against Democratic Michael L. Kripchak of Youngstown, who he defeated by 9.7% in the June 11 special election, for a full two-year term in the Nov. 5 general election.\\n\\nThe 6th Congressional District includes all of Mahoning, Columbiana, Carroll, Jefferson, Belmont, Harrison, Monroe, Noble and Washington counties and portions of Stark and Tuscarawas counties.   \n",

on August 5 after student activists led an uprising against her government, is herself accused of responsibility for much of the deadly violence, along with top officials of her administration.\\n\\nIn a statement posted on the social media platform X, formerly Twitter, by her son Sajeeb Wazed Joy, Ms Hasina said: “I demand punishment for those responsible for the killings and sabotage, through investigation.”\\n\\nProtesters celebrate beside a defaced portrait of prime minister Sheikh Hasina after news of her resignation, in Dhaka, Bangladesh (Fatima Tuj Johora/AP)\\n\\nIt was her first public statement since leaving the country.\\n\\nMore than 300 people were killed in unrest that started in July with protests against a quota system for government jobs that later morphed into a movement against Ms Hasina’s administration.\\n\\nEarlier on Tuesday, police launched a murder investigation in what was expected to be the first of several cases accusing Ms Hasina and other government officials of responsibility for deaths during the unrest.\\n\\nThe case launched on Tuesday involved the killing of a grocery shop owner in July.\\n\\nSM Amir Hamza, described as a “well-wisher” of grocery store owner Abu Sayeed, filed the case at the court of Dhaka Metropolitan Magistrate Rajesh Chowdhury.\\n\\nMr Hamza said Sayeed was killed on July 19 amid clashes during the student-led uprising, and that he filed the case because Ms Sayeed’s family did not have the capacity to seek justice.\\n\\nMen run past a burning vehicle inside the Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University Hospital, set on fire by protesters during a rally against Sheikh Hasina (AP)\\n\\nMs Hasina was named as a suspect in the petition along six other people including former home minister Asaduzzaman Khan, general secretary of then ruling Awami League party Obaidul Quader, and top police officials.\\n\\nThe Dhaka court asked the Mohammadpur Police Station to register the case. Police will now investigate the case and file a report to the court.\\n\\nThe uprising forced Ms Hasina to leave office and flee to India, ending a 15-year rule that turned increasingly autocratic, her critics say.\\n\\nAn interim government is now running the country.\\n\\nOn Thursday, Muhammad Yunus, a Nobel peace laureate, was sworn in as interim leader.\\n\\nThe chaos on Bangladesh’s streets continued after Ms Hasina’s resignation.\\n\\nDozens of police officers were killed, prompting police to stop working across the country. Police officers have gradually returned to work.   \n",

candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. no longer faces an attempt to disqualify him from the Maine ballot, after a challenger withdrew allegations of petition and residency issues.\\n\\nJames Stretch, whose experience in Democratic politics includes working for President Joe Biden’s campaign in 2020, informed Maine Secretary of State Shenna Bellows on Monday that he was withdrawing his challenge to Kennedy’s petition to appear on the November ballot. Bellows, a Democrat, dismissed the challenge Tuesday.\\n\\nStretch did not provide a reason for the withdrawal. His attorney did not immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday.\\n\\nThe withdrawal came amid a New York judge ruling Monday that Kennedy should not appear on that state’s ballot due to him living in California but falsely claiming on his petition to reside in New York. Stretch made a similar argument in his request to disqualify Kennedy here.\\n\\nBellows is still set to hear two separate challenges Thursday to independent candidate Cornel West’s candidacy. The requests from several Maine residents to disqualify West and Kennedy essentially argued the campaigns failed to follow state law and submit petitions with between 4,000 and 5,000 valid signatures from registered Maine voters.\\n\\nKennedy, the son of ex-Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy and nephew of former President John F. Kennedy, is an environmental attorney known for his anti-vaccine views. West is a scholar and progressive activist who previously taught at Princeton and Harvard.   \n",

The groundwater would likely cover the entirety of Mars to a depth of 1 mile (1.6 kilometers), the study found.\\n\\nThe data came from NASA’s InSight lander, which used a seismometer to study the interior of Mars from 2018 to 2022.\\n\\nFuture astronauts exploring Mars would encounter a whole host of challenges if they tried to access the water, because it’s located between 7 and 12 miles (11.5 and 20 kilometers) beneath the surface, according to the study published Monday in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\\n\\nBut the finding uncovers new details about the geological history of Mars — and suggests a new place to search for life on the red planet if the water could ever be accessed.\\n\\n“Understanding the Martian water cycle is critical for understanding the evolution of the climate, surface and interior,” said lead study author Vashan Wright, assistant professor and geophysicist at the University of California, San Diego’s Scripps Institution of Oceanography, in a statement. “A useful starting point is to identify where water is and how much is there.”\\n\\nThe search for ‘lost’ water on Mars\\n\\nMars was likely a warmer, wetter place billions of years ago, based on the evidence of ancient lakes, river channels, deltas and rocks altered by water studied by other NASA missions and observed by orbiters. But the red planet lost its atmosphere more than 3 billion years ago, which effectively ended the wet period on Mars.\\n\\nScientists still aren’t sure why Mars lost its atmosphere, and a multitude of missions have been developed to learn about the history of the planet’s water, where it went, and whether water ever created habitable conditions for life on Mars. While water remains trapped as ice at the planet’s polar ice caps, researchers don’t believe that can account for all the planet’s “lost” water.\\n\\nExisting theories offer a few likely scenarios for what happened to Martian water after Mars lost its atmosphere: Some hypothesize it became ice or was lost to space, while others suggest it was incorporated into minerals beneath the planet’s surface or trickled into deep aquifers.\\n\\nThe new findings suggest that water on Mars filtered down into the Martian crust.\\n\\nInSight, short for Interior Exploration using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport, was a stationary lander. But it collected unprecedented data about the thickness of the red planet’s crust and the temperature of its mantle, as well as the depth and composition of the core and atmosphere. The lander’s seismometer detected the first quakes on another planet, dubbed marsquakes.\\n\\nWhile earthquakes occur when tectonic plates shift, move and grind against one another, the Martian crust is like one giant plate with faults and fractures as the planet continues to shrink and cool over time. As the Martian crust stretches, it cracks, and InSight’s seismometer was able to detect more than 1,300 marsquakes as they rumbled from hundreds and thousands of miles away.\\n\\nScientists studying InSight’s data were able to study the speed of marsquakes as they traveled through the planet, which can serve as an indicator of what substances exist beneath the Martian surface.\\n\\nThe speed of seismic waves depends on what the rock is made of, where it has cracks and what fills those cracks, Wright said.\\n\\nThe team used this data and fed it into a mathematical model of rock physics, which is used on Earth to map underground oil fields and aquifers.\\n\\nThe results showed that InSight’s data best matches up with a deep layer of igneous, or volcanic, rock that is filled with liquid water.\\n\\n“Establishing that there is a big reservoir of liquid water provides some window into what the climate was like or could be like,” said study coauthor Michael Manga, a professor of earth and planetary science at the University of California, Berkeley, in a statement.\\n\\n“And water is necessary for life as we know it. I don’t see why (the underground reservoir) is not a habitable environment,” Manga added. “It’s certainly true on Earth — deep, deep mines host life, the bottom of the ocean hosts life. We haven’t found any evidence for life on Mars, but at least we have identified a place that should, in principle, be able to sustain life.”\\n\\nIf Mars’ crust is similar across the planet, there may be more water within the mid-crust zone than the “volumes proposed to have filled hypothesized ancient Martian oceans,” the authors wrote in the study.\\n\\nRocks help trap information about the history of a planet, and understanding the water cycle of a planet can help researchers unlock the evolution of Mars, Wright said.\\n\\nWhile the analysis of the data can’t reveal any information about life, past or present, if it existed on Mars, it’s possible that wet Martian crust could be habitable in the same way that deep groundwater on Earth is hospitable for microbial life, he said.\\n\\nBut even drilling holes just half a mile (1 kilometer) or deeper on Earth is a challenge that requires energy and infrastructure, so a massive number of resources would need to be brought to Mars to drill to such depths, Wright said.\\n\\nThe team was surprised not to find evidence suggesting a layer of frozen groundwater beneath Insight because that portion of the crust is cold. The researchers are still trying to determine why there isn’t frozen groundwater at shallower depths above the mid-crust.\\n\\nWindows into Martian history\\n\\nThe findings add a new piece to the Martian water puzzle.\\n\\nThe idea that liquid water may exist deep beneath the Martian surface has been around for decades, but this is the first time real data from a Mars mission can confirm such speculation, said Alberto Fairén, a visiting interdisciplinary planetary scientist and astrobiologist within the department of astronomy at Cornell University. Fairén was not involved in the study.\\n\\nHe said the water is likely “a kind of deep underground mud.”\\n\\n“These new results demonstrate that liquid water does exist in the Martian subsurface today, not in the form of discrete and isolated lakes, but as liquid water-saturated sediments, or aquifers,” Fairén said. “On Earth, the subsurface biosphere is truly vast, containing most of the prokaryotic diversity and biomass on our planet. Some investigations even point to an origin of life on Earth precisely deep in the subsurface. Therefore, the astrobiological implications of finally confirming the existence of liquid water habitats kilometers beneath the surface of Mars are truly exciting.”\\n\\nThe result is “exactly the kind of thing that I hoped we would get out of InSight,” said Bruce Banerdt, the principal investigator for the InSight mission.\\n\\n“I was hoping that we would get data that was good enough to do these kinds of studies where we’re actually looking at details of the inside of Mars that are relevant to geological questions, questions about the habitability of Mars, questions about the evolution of Mars,” he said.\\n\\nBanerdt, who was not involved in the research, said that while the interpretation of the data presented in the paper is strongly supported with good arguments, he also believes it is still somewhat speculative and that there is almost always another way to explain any given set of data.\\n\\n“I was really impressed by the fact that Wright et al brought in mineral physics concepts to interpret seismic data,” Banerdt said.\\n\\nBanerdt and Wright both expressed an interest in the ability to send more seismometers to Mars and other planets and moons within our solar system in the future. While InSight’s one seismometer gathered crucial data, spreading them out across Mars would reveal variations within the planet’s interior and provide a greater window into its diverse and complex history, Banerdt said.\\n\\n“Just as on Earth, where groundwater is connected to the surface through rivers and lakes, this was surely the case on early Mars as well,” Wright said. “The groundwater we see is a record of that past.”\\n\\nThe-CNN-Wire\\n\\n™ & © 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

The water is believed to be trapped in the cracks and pores of rocks in the Martian crust, located between 7 and 12 miles deep. Although this discovery sheds light on Mars' geological history and the possibility of life, accessing the water presents considerable challenges for future astronauts. Researchers used seismic data from InSight to analyze the Martian crust and determine the composition and characteristics of the subsurface materials, suggesting that water may have filtered down into the crust over time.

       "      <td>A hearse bearing the casket of Danilo Santos Romano rolled through the streets of Penha, a working class neighborhood of Sao Paulo’s east side, en route to the cemetery that lies beneath his apartment. Family members and friends walked behind the vehicle and dozens of shop owners who knew him as a regular customer gathered on the sidewalks to applaud as it passed. Romano was 35.\\n\\nSAO PAULO (AP) — The pilot of the plane that crashed down in Brazil last week was buried Monday in Sao Paulo, becoming the first person laid to rest among the 62 victims, as authorities continue working to determine what exactly caused the accident.\\n\\n“He had lived abroad, worked for foreign companies, but was always humble,\" Moura said. \"We used to chat about soccer, he really wanted to have a child to take to the stadium one day. Danilo was full of life.”\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nThe crash Friday killed 58 passengers and four crew members. Footage of the plane plunging while in a flat spin horrified people around the world, and the cause of the accident has yet to be determined. Some experts have pointed to the possibility of severe icing on the wings, which caused pilots to lose control of the plane, but airports minister Silvio Costa Filho told reporters Friday that Romano and his copilot made no calls for an emergency landing, nor did they communicate any adverse weather conditions.\\n\\nThey were flying the ATR 72 twin-engine turboprop for local airline Voepass, headed for the Guarulhos international airport, but the plane plunged from the sky in the nearby city of Vinhedo. Romano had just finished his first full year as commander for Voepass, which hired him as a copilot in November 2022, the airline told the AP in a statement. It added Romano had logged 5,202 hours flying for Voepass, all in ATRs. It is the only type of plane the company owns.\\n\\nRomano's widow, Thalita Valente Machado, didn’t speak to journalists gathered outside the ceremony, but provided a letter with a list of the people and organizations she wished to thank.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n“We want to give a very special thanks to his flight partner Humberto de Campos Alencar e Silva, who fought together with Danilo,\" her letter said. “We are sure they did everything possible and that they are heroes.”\\n\\nRomano’s burial followed a wake at a basilica Monday morning. One of the pilot’s heroes, the former goalkeeper for Brazil’s national soccer team and World Cup winner Marcos, was in attendance. Two of Romano’s friends told the AP that during the ceremony his 30-year-old widow repeatedly said “I lost a part of myself.”\\n\\nRomano's body was the first to be released by Sao Paulo's morgue after the crash. The morgue began receiving corpses Friday evening, and asked victims’ relatives to bring in medical, X-ray and dental records to help identify them. As of Monday evening, forensic experts had identified 17 bodies and returned eight to victims' relatives, Sao Paulo state's government said.\\n\\nMeanwhile in Cascavel, the city from which the doomed flight departed, more than a dozen families are awaiting the remains of their loved ones. Mayor Leonaldo Paranhos said on his social media channels that the city will make a conference center available should anyone wish to hold a collective wake in the space.\\n\\n“We are still waiting for information from Sao Paulo's morgue, which is still working to identify the bodies and communicate with the families,” Paranhos said. “Voepass will be responsible for sending the remains to their destinations.”\\n\\nAuthorities recovered both the plane’s “black boxes” — one with flight data and the other with cockpit audio — that are key to determining what exactly went awry. The air force’s center for the investigation and prevention of air accidents began analyzing them at its laboratory in the nation’s capital, Brasilia, and said it will issue a preliminary report within 30 days. Minister Costa Filho said the center was also opening a criminal probe.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nVoepass and French-Italian plane manufacturer ATR are collaborating with the investigations, they said in separate statements.</td>\n",

Romano, 35, was laid to rest as the first of the 62 victims of the crash, which occurred while he was piloting a flight for local airline Voepass. The cause of the crash remains under investigation, with initial theories suggesting severe icing on the wings, although the pilots made no distress calls.

(WDRB) -- A southern Indiana city is working on a program to prevent crime, and it's calling on the community to help.\\n\\nThe Madison Police Department is launching a Neighborhood Watch Program.\\n\\nWhile the overall concept isn't new, it is a new push for the small town.\\n\\n\"We've had some resemblance of a neighborhood watch program in the past. This is the most formal and kind of the largest structured community outreach effort that we've embarked on,\" said Madison Mayor Bob Courtney.\\n\\nCourtney said this effort is about partnerships with the community.\\n\\n\"We already have a very safe community and again, the communication is critical and it also helps our police officers just apply the resources where they need to be applied,\" he said.\\n\\nAccording to the Madison Police Department, the Neighborhood Watch Program encourages community engagement and collaboration with police and neighbors to prevent crime.\\n\\n\"It's important for us to have because it creates that connection between the citizens of Madison and the police department,\" said Madison Police Chief Shawn Scudder. \"A lot of times citizens feel disconnected or their voices aren't heard. This gives them an avenue to have direct contact with us when they have direct concerns.\"\\n\\nThrough the program, community members work together to monitor and report suspicious activities to police. The city has been divided into 12 neighborhoods for the Neighborhood Watch Program. Each one will be represented by what police are calling a \"Neighborhood Captain.\" That person will serve as the liaison between neighborhood members and the police department.\\n\\nScudder said each Neighborhood Captain will be chosen through a collaborative effort between members of the community and the police department.\\n\\n\"We want somebody who is going to be a good communicator. We can stay in touch with the neighborhood captain,\" he said.\\n\\nAccording to police, the captain will share information with the neighborhood watch members, create and maintain a neighborhood watch phone tree, and create a neighborhood watch Facebook group.\\n\\nThe first meeting is scheduled for Aug. 19. Each of the 12 neighborhoods has a different meeting time and location. For a list of locations, click here.\\n\\nTo view a map of the neighborhoods, click here.\\n\\nWatch members are asked to serve as the \"eyes and ears\" of their neighborhoods.\\n\\n\"Public safety is a key initiative for the city. It's the largest resource that we budget for throughout the year,\" Courtney said.\\n\\nAccording to Scudder, the Madison Police Department is about three or four officers short from being fully staffed with 35 officers. While the city hasn't seen an increase in crime, Scudder said this new program is a way for police to be more transparent and connect with the community.\\n\\n\"This will just help us identify problems easier so that we can be in the neighborhoods that we need to be in,\" Scudder said.\\n\\nThe program's goal is to have police more present in areas of need.\\n\\nMore Stories From Madison, Indiana:\\n\\nCopyright 2024 WDRB Media.

(AP Photo/Charles Krupa, File)\\n\\nStarbucks, struggling with weak demand and disgruntled investors, said Tuesday that CEO Laxman Narasimhan is stepping down after a little more than a year in the job.\\n\\nThe Seattle coffee giant said Brian Niccol, the chairman and CEO of Chipotle, will become Starbucks' chairman and CEO on Sept. 9.\\n\\nStarbucks shares jumped more than 13% before the market opened.\\n\\nNarasimhan, a longtime PepsiCo executive who has also served as the CEO of Reckitt, a U.K.-based consumer health company, became Starbucks' CEO in March 2023. He succeeded Howard Schultz, the longtime Starbucks leader and chairman emeritus who came out of retirement in 2022 to serve as the company's interim CEO.\\n\\nBut investors quickly soured on Narasimhan as the company's sales weakened and it dealt with multiple issues, including competition from lower-cost competitors in China and boycotts in the Middle East and elsewhere due to its perceived support for Israel.\\n\\nMellody Hobson, the chair of Starbucks' board of directors, said Niccol has transformed Chipotle since becoming its CEO in 2018 by focusing on menu innovation, operational excellence and digital transformation.\\n\\n“Brian is a culture carrier who brings a wealth of experience and a proven track record of driving innovation and growth,\" Hobson said in a statement. “Like all of us at Starbucks, he understands that a remarkable customer experience is rooted in an exceptional partner experience.”\\n\\nSchultz said he has long admired Niccol.\\n\\n\"I believe he is the leader Starbucks needs at a pivotal moment in its history.

       "1  A hearse bearing the casket of Danilo Santos Romano rolled through the streets of Penha, a working class neighborhood of Sao Paulo’s east side, en route to the cemetery that lies beneath his apartment. Family members and friends walked behind the vehicle and dozens of shop owners who knew him as a regular customer gathered on the sidewalks to applaud as it passed. Romano was 35.\\n\\nSAO PAULO (AP) — The pilot of the plane that crashed down in Brazil last week was buried Monday in Sao Paulo, becoming the first person laid to rest among the 62 victims, as authorities continue working to determine what exactly caused the accident.\\n\\n“He had lived abroad, worked for foreign companies, but was always humble,\" Moura said. \"We used to chat about soccer, he really wanted to have a child to take to the stadium one day. Danilo was full of life.”\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nThe crash Friday killed 58 passengers and four crew members. Footage of the plane plunging while in a flat spin horrified people around the world, and the cause of the accident has yet to be determined. Some experts have pointed to the possibility of severe icing on the wings, which caused pilots to lose control of the plane, but airports minister Silvio Costa Filho told reporters Friday that Romano and his copilot made no calls for an emergency landing, nor did they communicate any adverse weather conditions.\\n\\nThey were flying the ATR 72 twin-engine turboprop for local airline Voepass, headed for the Guarulhos international airport, but the plane plunged from the sky in the nearby city of Vinhedo. Romano had just finished his first full year as commander for Voepass, which hired him as a copilot in November 2022, the airline told the AP in a statement. It added Romano had logged 5,202 hours flying for Voepass, all in ATRs. It is the only type of plane the company owns.\\n\\nRomano's widow, Thalita Valente Machado, didn’t speak to journalists gathered outside the ceremony, but provided a letter with a list of the people and organizations she wished to thank.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n“We want to give a very special thanks to his flight partner Humberto de Campos Alencar e Silva, who fought together with Danilo,\" her letter said. “We are sure they did everything possible and that they are heroes.”\\n\\nRomano’s burial followed a wake at a basilica Monday morning. One of the pilot’s heroes, the former goalkeeper for Brazil’s national soccer team and World Cup winner Marcos, was in attendance. Two of Romano’s friends told the AP that during the ceremony his 30-year-old widow repeatedly said “I lost a part of myself.”\\n\\nRomano's body was the first to be released by Sao Paulo's morgue after the crash. The morgue began receiving corpses Friday evening, and asked victims’ relatives to bring in medical, X-ray and dental records to help identify them. As of Monday evening, forensic experts had identified 17 bodies and returned eight to victims' relatives, Sao Paulo state's government said.\\n\\nMeanwhile in Cascavel, the city from which the doomed flight departed, more than a dozen families are awaiting the remains of their loved ones. Mayor Leonaldo Paranhos said on his social media channels that the city will make a conference center available should anyone wish to hold a collective wake in the space.\\n\\n“We are still waiting for information from Sao Paulo's morgue, which is still working to identify the bodies and communicate with the families,” Paranhos said. “Voepass will be responsible for sending the remains to their destinations.”\\n\\nAuthorities recovered both the plane’s “black boxes” — one with flight data and the other with cockpit audio — that are key to determining what exactly went awry.

(WDRB) -- A southern Indiana city is working on a program to prevent crime, and it's calling on the community to help.\\n\\nThe Madison Police Department is launching a Neighborhood Watch Program.\\n\\nWhile the overall concept isn't new, it is a new push for the small town.\\n\\n\"We've had some resemblance of a neighborhood watch program in the past. This is the most formal and kind of the largest structured community outreach effort that we've embarked on,\" said Madison Mayor Bob Courtney.\\n\\nCourtney said this effort is about partnerships with the community.\\n\\n\"We already have a very safe community and again, the communication is critical and it also helps our police officers just apply the resources where they need to be applied,\" he said.\\n\\nAccording to the Madison Police Department, the Neighborhood Watch Program encourages community engagement and collaboration with police and neighbors to prevent crime.\\n\\n\"It's important for us to have because it creates that connection between the citizens of Madison and the police department,\" said Madison Police Chief Shawn Scudder. \"A lot of times citizens feel disconnected or their voices aren't heard. This gives them an avenue to have direct contact with us when they have direct concerns.\"\\n\\nThrough the program, community members work together to monitor and report suspicious activities to police. The city has been divided into 12 neighborhoods for the Neighborhood Watch Program. Each one will be represented by what police are calling a \"Neighborhood Captain.\" That person will serve as the liaison between neighborhood members and the police department.\\n\\nScudder said each Neighborhood Captain will be chosen through a collaborative effort between members of the community and the police department.\\n\\n\"We want somebody who is going to be a good communicator. We can stay in touch with the neighborhood captain,\" he said.\\n\\nAccording to police, the captain will share information with the neighborhood watch members, create and maintain a neighborhood watch phone tree, and create a neighborhood watch Facebook group.\\n\\nThe first meeting is scheduled for Aug. 19. Each of the 12 neighborhoods has a different meeting time and location.

It's the largest resource that we budget for throughout the year,\" Courtney said.\\n\\nAccording to Scudder, the Madison Police Department is about three or four officers short from being fully staffed with 35 officers. While the city hasn't seen an increase in crime, Scudder said this new program is a way for police to be more transparent and connect with the community.\\n\\n\"This will just help us identify problems easier so that we can be in the neighborhoods that we need to be in,\" Scudder said.\\n\\nThe program's goal is to have police more present in areas of need.\\n\\nMore Stories From Madison, Indiana:\\n\\nCopyright 2024 WDRB Media.

In addition to the Penguin Club donations, the PAC spent $2,739.83 on compliance services and $2,175 on software in July.\\n\\nIt had $865,312.04 in the fund as of July 31.\\n\\nBill’s PAC notified the FEC on Jan. 15 that it was going to file monthly after reporting quarterly. The filing deadline for this latest report is Aug. 20, but Johnson’s PAC filed eight days early.\\n\\nLeadership PACs are established by members of Congress and other political leaders to support candidates for federal and nonfederal offices, according to the FEC.\\n\\nJohnson represented the 6th Congressional District for 13 years before his Jan. 21 resignation to become YSU president.\\n\\nWhen Johnson was planning to run for reelection before his YSU hire, his committee raised $860,848 and spent $1,047,891 in 2023.\\n\\nBecause of a large surplus from previous campaigns, he ended 2023 with a near $1 million surplus in his fund. It would have been even more but Johnson gave a $235,000 contribution on Nov. 29 to the National Republican Congressional Committee as part of an overall spending amount of $402,583.28 during 2023’s fourth quarter.\\n\\nJohnson also closed the Johnson Leads Committee on Feb. 15. That was a joint fundraising committee formed by Johnson’s now-closed campaign committee, Bill’s PAC and the National Republican Congressional Committee.\\n\\nRepublican Michael Rulli of Salem won a June 11 special election for Johnson’s unexpired term. Rulli resigned his state senator position the day after the election and was sworn in June 25 to the U.S. House.\\n\\nRulli will run Nov. 5 against Democratic Michael L. Kripchak of Youngstown, who he defeated by 9.7% in the June 11 special election, for a full two-year term in the Nov. 5 general election.\\n\\nThe 6th Congressional District includes all of Mahoning, Columbiana, Carroll, Jefferson, Belmont, Harrison, Monroe, Noble and Washington counties and portions of Stark and Tuscarawas counties.   \n",

Effective September 9, Brian Niccol, the current CEO of Chipotle, will take over as chairman and CEO of Starbucks. Narasimhan's tenure was marked by declining sales and increased competition, leading to a negative investor sentiment. Niccol is expected to bring innovation and strategic growth to Starbucks, with support from former CEO Howard Schultz. Following the announcement, Starbucks shares rose over 13%.   \n",

This included a $2,000 donation on July 24 and a $5,242 donation the next day. Johnson's PAC, which had over $875,000 remaining as of July, makes contributions to candidates and organizations and had previously transferred funds from his congressional account.

Romano, 35, was laid to rest as the first of the 62 victims of the crash, which occurred while he was piloting a flight for local airline Voepass. The cause of the crash remains under investigation, with initial theories suggesting severe icing on the wings, although the pilots made no distress calls. Authorities are analyzing the plane's black boxes as part of their inquiry, and a criminal probe has been initiated. As families await news of their loved ones, a community wake is being organized in Cascavel for those who wish to honor the victims collectively.   \n",

The city has been divided into 12 neighborhoods, each represented by a \"Neighborhood Captain\" who will act as a liaison, facilitating the reporting of suspicious activities. The program seeks to connect residents with the police, helping them feel heard and allowing for proactive crime prevention. The first community meetings are scheduled for August 19.   \n",

(AP Photo/Charles Krupa, File)\\n\\nStarbucks, struggling with weak demand and disgruntled investors, said Tuesday that CEO Laxman Narasimhan is stepping down after a little more than a year in the job.\\n\\nThe Seattle coffee giant said Brian Niccol, the chairman and CEO of Chipotle, will become Starbucks\\' chairman and CEO on Sept. 9.\\n\\nStarbucks shares jumped more than 13% before the market opened.\\n\\nNarasimhan, a longtime PepsiCo executive who has also served as the CEO of Reckitt, a U.K.-based consumer health company, became Starbucks\\' CEO in March 2023. He succeeded Howard Schultz, the longtime Starbucks leader and chairman emeritus who came out of retirement in 2022 to serve as the company\\'s interim CEO.\\n\\nBut investors quickly soured on Narasimhan as the company\\'s sales weakened and it dealt with multiple issues, including competition from lower-cost competitors in China and boycotts in the Middle East and elsewhere due to its perceived support for Israel.\\n\\nMellody Hobson, the chair of Starbucks\\' board of directors, said Niccol has transformed Chipotle since becoming its CEO in 2018 by focusing on menu innovation, operational excellence and digital transformation.\\n\\n“Brian is a culture carrier who brings a wealth of experience and a proven track record of driving innovation and growth,\" Hobson said in a statement. “Like all of us at Starbucks, he understands that a remarkable customer experience is rooted in an exceptional partner experience.”\\n\\nSchultz said he has long admired Niccol.\\n\\n\"I believe he is the leader Starbucks needs at a pivotal moment in its history. He has my respect and full support,” Schultz said in a statement.'"

(AP Photo/Charles Krupa, File)\\n\\nStarbucks, struggling with weak demand and disgruntled investors, said Tuesday that CEO Laxman Narasimhan is stepping down after a little more than a year in the job.\\n\\nThe Seattle coffee giant said Brian Niccol, the chairman and CEO of Chipotle, will become Starbucks\\' chairman and CEO on Sept. 9.\\n\\nStarbucks shares jumped more than 13% before the market opened.\\n\\nNarasimhan, a longtime PepsiCo executive who has also served as the CEO of Reckitt, a U.K.-based consumer health company, became Starbucks\\' CEO in March 2023. He succeeded Howard Schultz, the longtime Starbucks leader and chairman emeritus who came out of retirement in 2022 to serve as the company\\'s interim CEO.\\n\\nBut investors quickly soured on Narasimhan as the company\\'s sales weakened and it dealt with multiple issues, including competition from lower-cost competitors in China and boycotts in the Middle East and elsewhere due to its perceived support for Israel.\\n\\nMellody Hobson, the chair of Starbucks\\' board of directors, said Niccol has transformed Chipotle since becoming its CEO in 2018 by focusing on menu innovation, operational excellence and digital transformation.\\n\\n“Brian is a culture carrier who brings a wealth of experience and a proven track record of driving innovation and growth,\" Hobson said in a statement. “Like all of us at Starbucks, he understands that a remarkable customer experience is rooted in an exceptional partner experience.”\\n\\nSchultz said he has long admired Niccol.\\n\\n\"I believe he is the leader Starbucks needs at a pivotal moment in its history. He has my respect and full support,” Schultz said in a statement.',\n",

He succeeded Howard Schultz, the longtime Starbucks leader and chairman emeritus who came out of retirement in 2022 to serve as the company&#39;s interim CEO.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>But investors quickly soured on Narasimhan as the company&#39;s sales weakened and it dealt with multiple issues, including competition from lower-cost competitors in China and <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/starbucks-war-palestinians-israel-boycott-labor-3b1165fc74ed181a4a5dad2106779922\">boycotts in the Middle East and elsewhere</a> due to its perceived support for Israel.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Mellody Hobson, the chair of Starbucks&#39; board of directors, said Niccol has transformed Chipotle since becoming its CEO in 2018 by focusing on menu innovation, operational excellence and digital transformation.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>&ldquo;Brian is a culture carrier who brings a wealth of experience and a proven track record of driving innovation and growth,&quot; Hobson said in a statement. &ldquo;Like all of us at Starbucks, he understands that a remarkable customer experience is rooted in an exceptional partner experience.&rdquo;</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Schultz said he has long admired Niccol.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>&quot;I believe he is the leader Starbucks needs at a pivotal moment in its history.
