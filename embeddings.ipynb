      "You may remember that just over a week ago, we reported that Police were looking for a man that shoved an elderly man to the ground in Nampa. Then, as Nampa Police continued to search for the man--we learned that he was a 'Hollywood celeb' that played none other than...the green Power Ranger. Here's a look at the incident that took place in a Nampa parking lot just over one week ago: The video--and the scene--is horribly difficult to watch. According to an update from local news reporter Daisy Bautista, who acquired court documents, the parking lot confrontation stemmed from Hector David Rivera parking in a handicap spot. Apparently, from 2011-2015, Rivera played the green Power Ranger and was in Idaho for an appearance at the Magic Valley Comic-Con.\n",
      "Laurel V Williams JALANI Mapp, the man charged with causing the death of a delivery driver and four other driving offences, has been granted $150,000 own bail. On August 13, he faced a master, Margaret Sookraj-Goswami, virtually in the High Court, but was not called on to plead as the charges were laid indictably. Ballai was driving one of the company's Isuzu trucks, with his co-worker, Terrence Jagessar, 34, in the passenger seat. This new legislation allows indictable cases to go straight to the High Court. In the past, such cases were heard at the magistrates' court, where a preliminary inquiry would determine if there was sufficient evidence to go to trial at the High Court.\n",

      "Acting Director at the Health Promotion Division of the Ghana Health Service (GHS), Mabel Asafo has attributed Ghana's inability to tackle basic but critical health areas to inadequate private sector support. \"We started earlier on but we did not engage the private sector much and so we did not succeed. The Chairperson of the National Committee for Inter-Agency Coordination Council, Health Promotion, Professor Kaufman reiterated the need for partnership between the private sector and government towards promoting health across the country. She said that individual stakeholder efforts towards promoting health lead to waste of Ghana's limited resources and task duplication towards a single goal. The Health Promotion Division of GHS signed a Memoranda of Understanding (MoU) with seven Ghanaian private sector organizations who pledged their support for health interventions with a total private sector investment valued at 4.2 million cedis.\n",
      "The Kerala High Court on Tuesday dismissed a plea challenging the release of the Justice Hema committee report on sexual harassment and gender inequality in the Malayalam film industry, reported Bar and Bench. On July 24, the High Court stayed its release, hours before it was to be made public. The order came on a petition filed by filmmaker Sajimon Parayil, who challenged the Kerala State Information Commission’s July 6 directive ordering the findings of the committee to be made public. The collective had demanded an investigation into the problems faced by women in the Malayalam film industry. The state information commission assured that all personal details had been redacted from the report to protect individuals’ privacy.\n",

      "Ford and Mazda are warning the owners of more than 475,000 older vehicles in the US not to drive them because they have dangerous Takata air bag inflators that have not been replaced. Worldwide at least 35 people have been killed by Takata inflators in Malaysia, Australia and the US. Potential for a dangerous malfunction led to the largest series of auto recalls in US history, with at least 67 million Takata inflators involved. “Even minor crashes can result in exploding Takata air bags that can kill or produce life-altering, gruesome injuries,” the agency said in a statement. “Older model year vehicles put their occupants at higher risk.” Ford says more than 765,000 inflators in Ford and Lincoln vehicles worldwide should not be driven until the air bag inflators have been replaced.\n",

      "On 16 August 2024, the University of Cape Town and the Metropolitan University of Hong Kong will sign a historic Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) which is the first of its kind to establish official working relations between the two universities.
