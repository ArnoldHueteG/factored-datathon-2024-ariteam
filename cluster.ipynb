It was unclear whether the agency simultaneously would authorize Novavax’s updated shot, which targets the JN.1 strain.\\n\\nThe move would be several weeks ahead of last year’s version of the vaccine, which got FDA signoff on September 11.\\n\\n“Now is the time to get a dose with this surge,” Dr. Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, told CNN.\\n\\nOsterholm said on his podcast last week that he recently got a dose of last season’s vaccine in order to increase his immunity while the virus is circulating at such high levels and amid uncertainty around when new shots would become available.\\n\\nHe added that he’ll now wait to get the updated one in four months, the interval recommended by health officials.\\n\\nIn June, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended that everyone over 6 months old receive both an updated Covid-19 vaccine and a flu shot this year.\\n\\nRepresentatives for Pfizer and Moderna told CNN that the companies had ample supply of their updated Covid vaccines and would be ready to ship doses upon approval. Moderna’s spokesman said it expects the vaccine to be available in stores within days of FDA signoff.\\n\\nNovavax’s vaccine is based on protein technology, which takes longer to manufacture than mRNA vaccines. The company’s executives told investors on a conference call last week that it anticipated that its updated vaccine would be arriving in warehouses this month and that it’s expected to be ready for distribution when authorized. A spokesperson for Novavax didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment Friday.\\n\\nA spokesperson for the FDA said the agency can’t comment on timing of product applications but noted that it “anticipates taking timely action to authorize or approve updated COVID-19 vaccines in order to make vaccines available this fall.”\\n\\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\\n\\nLevels of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes Covid-19, measured in wastewater are at “very high” levels nationally, according to CDC data, sparking the highest summer peak in the US since July 2022. Monitoring of viral levels in wastewater can give a picture of how widespread the virus is as testing and other forms of monitoring the virus have fallen off.\\n\\nMeasures of severe disease, including rates of hospitalization and death, have been rising, according to the CDC, but they’re nowhere near levels seen in previous years.\\n\\nWaves of the virus are driven by both waning immunity and new variants, experts say. The prevalent strain in the US now is KP.3.1.1, according to CDC data, estimated to account for 37% of cases over the past two weeks. That’s triple its level a month ago.\\n\\nKP.3.1.1 and KP.2 – the strain included in the updated mRNA vaccines – are both offshoots of JN.1, the target of Novavax’s shot, and all are versions of the Omicron variant.\\n\\nCNN’s Brenda Goodman contributed to this report.</td>\n",
       "      <td>The US FDA is expected to approve updated COVID-19 vaccines from Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech targeting the KP.2 strain, coinciding with a significant summer wave of infections. Approval may come this week, ahead of last year’s timeline. Experts emphasize the importance of vaccination amid rising cases; the CDC recommends that individuals over six months receive both an updated COVID-19 vaccine and a flu shot. While Moderna and Pfizer are ready to distribute their vaccines quickly upon approval, Novavax's shot will take longer due to its protein-based technology. Monitoring indicates high levels of the virus nationally, though severe disease rates remain lower than in past years.</td>\n",

A week ago, competitor Pfizer Inc. announced its own COVID-19 vaccine appeared similarly effective — news that puts both companies on track to seek permission within weeks for emergency use in the U.S.\\n\\nDr. Stephen Hoge, Moderna’s president, welcomed the “really important milestone” but said having similar results from two different companies is what’s most reassuring.\\n\\n“That should give us all hope that actually a vaccine is going to be able to stop this pandemic and hopefully get us back to our lives,” Hoge told The Associated Press.\\n\\n“It won’t be Moderna alone that solves this problem. It’s going to require many vaccines” to meet the global demand, he added.\\n\\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau said in late October that Canada has signed six agreements with a number of companies taking part in the global race to produce a safe and effective vaccine for COVID-19, including Moderna and Pfizer.\\n\\nBoth of those American vaccine makers have asked Health Canada to review their products.\\n\\nA vaccine can’t come fast enough, as case totals in Canada are rapidly approaching the 300,000 mark, even as long-standing national virus hot spots Quebec and Ontario recorded declines in their daily tallies on Sunday.\\n\\nIn the United States, the case total topped 11 million over the weekend — 1 million of them recorded in just the past week. The pandemic has killed more than 1.3 million people worldwide, more than 245,000 of them in the U.S.\\n\\nStill, if the U.S. Food and Drug Administration allows emergency use of Moderna’s or Pfizer’s candidates, there will be limited, rationed supplies before the end of the year. Both require people to get two shots, several weeks apart. Moderna expects to have about 20 million doses, earmarked for the U.S., by the end of 2020. Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech expect to have about 50 million doses globally by year’s end.\\n\\nModerna’s vaccine, created with the National Institutes of Health, is being studied in 30,000 volunteers who received either the real vaccination or a dummy shot. On Sunday, an independent monitoring board broke the code to examine 95 infections that were recorded starting two weeks after volunteers' second dose — and discovered all but five illnesses occurred in participants who got the placebo.\\n\\nThe study is continuing, and Moderna acknowledged the protection rate might change as more COVID-19 infections are detected and added to the calculations. Also, it’s too soon to know how long protection lasts. Both cautions apply to Pfizer’s vaccine as well.\\n\\nBut Moderna’s independent monitors reported some additional, promising tidbits: All 11 severe COVID-19 cases were among placebo recipients, and there were no significant safety concerns.\\n\\nThe main side effects were fatigue, muscle aches and injection-site pain after the vaccine’s second dose, at rates that Hoge characterized as more common than with flu shots but on par with others such as shingles vaccine.</td>\n",
       "      <td>Moderna has announced that its COVID-19 vaccine candidate shows a promising efficacy rate of 94.5%, providing hope amid rising coronavirus cases globally. This follows a similar announcement from Pfizer, leading both companies to seek emergency use authorization in the U.S. in the coming weeks. Despite the positive results from both vaccines, shortages are expected initially, with limited supplies available before the end of 2020. Moderna's vaccine study, involving 30,000 participants, found that severe cases of COVID-19 were only among those given a placebo, and the vaccine side effects were generally mild. The Canadian government is also pursuing agreements with multiple vaccine producers, including Moderna and Pfizer, as COVID-19 cases continue to surge.</td>\n",

       "0  CNN —\\n\\nThe US Food and Drug Administration is poised to sign off as soon as this week on updated Covid-19 vaccines targeting more recently circulating strains of the virus, according to two sources familiar with the matter, as the country experiences its largest summer wave in two years.\\n\\nThe agency is expected to greenlight updated mRNA vaccines from Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech that target a strain of the virus called KP.2, said the sources, who declined to be named because the timing information isn’t public. It was unclear whether the agency simultaneously would authorize Novavax’s updated shot, which targets the JN.1 strain.\\n\\nThe move would be several weeks ahead of last year’s version of the vaccine, which got FDA signoff on September 11.\\n\\n“Now is the time to get a dose with this surge,” Dr. Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, told CNN.\\n\\nOsterholm said on his podcast last week that he recently got a dose of last season’s vaccine in order to increase his immunity while the virus is circulating at such high levels and amid uncertainty around when new shots would become available.\\n\\nHe added that he’ll now wait to get the updated one in four months, the interval recommended by health officials.\\n\\nIn June, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended that everyone over 6 months old receive both an updated Covid-19 vaccine and a flu shot this year.\\n\\nRepresentatives for Pfizer and Moderna told CNN that the companies had ample supply of their updated Covid vaccines and would be ready to ship doses upon approval. Moderna’s spokesman said it expects the vaccine to be available in stores within days of FDA signoff.\\n\\nNovavax’s vaccine is based on protein technology, which takes longer to manufacture than mRNA vaccines. The company’s executives told investors on a conference call last week that it anticipated that its updated vaccine would be arriving in warehouses this month and that it’s expected to be ready for distribution when authorized. A spokesperson for Novavax didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment Friday.\\n\\nA spokesperson for the FDA said the agency can’t comment on timing of product applications but noted that it “anticipates taking timely action to authorize or approve updated COVID-19 vaccines in order to make vaccines available this fall.”\\n\\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\\n\\nLevels of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes Covid-19, measured in wastewater are at “very high” levels nationally, according to CDC data, sparking the highest summer peak in the US since July 2022. Monitoring of viral levels in wastewater can give a picture of how widespread the virus is as testing and other forms of monitoring the virus have fallen off.\\n\\nMeasures of severe disease, including rates of hospitalization and death, have been rising, according to the CDC, but they’re nowhere near levels seen in previous years.\\n\\nWaves of the virus are driven by both waning immunity and new variants, experts say. The prevalent strain in the US now is KP.3.1.1, according to CDC data, estimated to account for 37% of cases over the past two weeks. That’s triple its level a month ago.\\n\\nKP.3.1.1 and KP.2 – the strain included in the updated mRNA vaccines – are both offshoots of JN.1, the target of Novavax’s shot, and all are versions of the Omicron variant.\\n\\nCNN’s Brenda Goodman contributed to this report.   \n",

Both require people to get two shots, several weeks apart. Moderna expects to have about 20 million doses, earmarked for the U.S., by the end of 2020. Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech expect to have about 50 million doses globally by year’s end.\\n\\nModerna’s vaccine, created with the National Institutes of Health, is being studied in 30,000 volunteers who received either the real vaccination or a dummy shot. On Sunday, an independent monitoring board broke the code to examine 95 infections that were recorded starting two weeks after volunteers' second dose — and discovered all but five illnesses occurred in participants who got the placebo.\\n\\nThe study is continuing, and Moderna acknowledged the protection rate might change as more COVID-19 infections are detected and added to the calculations.

       "1  Moderna has announced that its COVID-19 vaccine candidate shows a promising efficacy rate of 94.5%, providing hope amid rising coronavirus cases globally. This follows a similar announcement from Pfizer, leading both companies to seek emergency use authorization in the U.S. in the coming weeks. Despite the positive results from both vaccines, shortages are expected initially, with limited supplies available before the end of 2020. Moderna's vaccine study, involving 30,000 participants, found that severe cases of COVID-19 were only among those given a placebo, and the vaccine side effects were generally mild. The Canadian government is also pursuing agreements with multiple vaccine producers, including Moderna and Pfizer, as COVID-19 cases continue to surge.  \n",

It was unclear whether the agency simultaneously would authorize Novavax’s updated shot, which targets the JN.1 strain.\\n\\nThe move would be several weeks ahead of last year’s version of the vaccine, which got FDA signoff on September 11.\\n\\n“Now is the time to get a dose with this surge,” Dr. Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, told CNN.\\n\\nOsterholm said on his podcast last week that he recently got a dose of last season’s vaccine in order to increase his immunity while the virus is circulating at such high levels and amid uncertainty around when new shots would become available.\\n\\nHe added that he’ll now wait to get the updated one in four months, the interval recommended by health officials.\\n\\nIn June, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended that everyone over 6 months old receive both an updated Covid-19 vaccine and a flu shot this year.\\n\\nRepresentatives for Pfizer and Moderna told CNN that the companies had ample supply of their updated Covid vaccines and would be ready to ship doses upon approval. Moderna’s spokesman said it expects the vaccine to be available in stores within days of FDA signoff.\\n\\nNovavax’s vaccine is based on protein technology, which takes longer to manufacture than mRNA vaccines. The company’s executives told investors on a conference call last week that it anticipated that its updated vaccine would be arriving in warehouses this month and that it’s expected to be ready for distribution when authorized. A spokesperson for Novavax didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment Friday.\\n\\nA spokesperson for the FDA said the agency can’t comment on timing of product applications but noted that it “anticipates taking timely action to authorize or approve updated COVID-19 vaccines in order to make vaccines available this fall.”\\n\\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\\n\\nLevels of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes Covid-19, measured in wastewater are at “very high” levels nationally, according to CDC data, sparking the highest summer peak in the US since July 2022. Monitoring of viral levels in wastewater can give a picture of how widespread the virus is as testing and other forms of monitoring the virus have fallen off.\\n\\nMeasures of severe disease, including rates of hospitalization and death, have been rising, according to the CDC, but they’re nowhere near levels seen in previous years.\\n\\nWaves of the virus are driven by both waning immunity and new variants, experts say. The prevalent strain in the US now is KP.3.1.1, according to CDC data, estimated to account for 37% of cases over the past two weeks. That’s triple its level a month ago.\\n\\nKP.3.1.1 and KP.2 – the strain included in the updated mRNA vaccines – are both offshoots of JN.1, the target of Novavax’s shot, and all are versions of the Omicron variant.\\n\\nCNN’s Brenda Goodman contributed to this report.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Photo: The Canadian Press\\n\\nFor the second time this month, there's promising news from a COVID-19 vaccine candidate: Moderna said Monday its shots provide strong protection, a dash of hope against the grim backdrop of coronavirus surges in the U.S. and around the world.\\n\\nModerna said its vaccine appears to be 94.5% effective, according to preliminary data from the company’s still ongoing study. A week ago, competitor Pfizer Inc. announced its own COVID-19 vaccine appeared similarly effective — news that puts both companies on track to seek permission within weeks for emergency use in the U.S.\\n\\nDr. Stephen Hoge, Moderna’s president, welcomed the “really important milestone” but said having similar results from two different companies is what’s most reassuring.\\n\\n“That should give us all hope that actually a vaccine is going to be able to stop this pandemic and hopefully get us back to our lives,” Hoge told The Associated Press.\\n\\n“It won’t be Moderna alone that solves this problem. It’s going to require many vaccines” to meet the global demand, he added.\\n\\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau said in late October that Canada has signed six agreements with a number of companies taking part in the global race to produce a safe and effective vaccine for COVID-19, including Moderna and Pfizer.\\n\\nBoth of those American vaccine makers have asked Health Canada to review their products.\\n\\nA vaccine can’t come fast enough, as case totals in Canada are rapidly approaching the 300,000 mark, even as long-standing national virus hot spots Quebec and Ontario recorded declines in their daily tallies on Sunday.\\n\\nIn the United States, the case total topped 11 million over the weekend — 1 million of them recorded in just the past week. The pandemic has killed more than 1.3 million people worldwide, more than 245,000 of them in the U.S.\\n\\nStill, if the U.S. Food and Drug Administration allows emergency use of Moderna’s or Pfizer’s candidates, there will be limited, rationed supplies before the end of the year. Both require people to get two shots, several weeks apart. Moderna expects to have about 20 million doses, earmarked for the U.S., by the end of 2020. Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech expect to have about 50 million doses globally by year’s end.\\n\\nModerna’s vaccine, created with the National Institutes of Health, is being studied in 30,000 volunteers who received either the real vaccination or a dummy shot. On Sunday, an independent monitoring board broke the code to examine 95 infections that were recorded starting two weeks after volunteers' second dose — and discovered all but five illnesses occurred in participants who got the placebo.\\n\\nThe study is continuing, and Moderna acknowledged the protection rate might change as more COVID-19 infections are detected and added to the calculations. Also, it’s too soon to know how long protection lasts. Both cautions apply to Pfizer’s vaccine as well.\\n\\nBut Moderna’s independent monitors reported some additional, promising tidbits: All 11 severe COVID-19 cases were among placebo recipients, and there were no significant safety concerns.\\n\\nThe main side effects were fatigue, muscle aches and injection-site pain after the vaccine’s second dose, at rates that Hoge characterized as more common than with flu shots but on par with others such as shingles vaccine.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Moderna has announced that its COVID-19 vaccine candidate shows a promising efficacy rate of 94.5%, providing hope amid rising coronavirus cases globally. This follows a similar announcement from Pfizer, leading both companies to seek emergency use authorization in the U.S. in the coming weeks. Despite the positive results from both vaccines, shortages are expected initially, with limited supplies available before the end of 2020. Moderna's vaccine study, involving 30,000 participants, found that severe cases of COVID-19 were only among those given a placebo, and the vaccine side effects were generally mild. The Canadian government is also pursuing agreements with multiple vaccine producers, including Moderna and Pfizer, as COVID-19 cases continue to surge.</td>\n",

       "      <td>A global technology outage caused by a faulty update from cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike has impacted around 50,000 devices in British Columbia's hospitals, leading staff to revert to paper systems for managing lab work and meal orders. Health Minister Adrian Dix noted that efforts were made to limit the impact on patient care as systems gradually come back online. Although the outage affected hospital operations, it did not disrupt critical services such as the provincial wildfire service or 911. B.C. Premier David Eby indicated that inputting paper records back into electronic health systems would incur extra work for healthcare facilities. Residents are advised not to contact hospital switchboards during this time.</td>\n",

       "0  CNN —\\n\\nThe US Food and Drug Administration is poised to sign off as soon as this week on updated Covid-19 vaccines targeting more recently circulating strains of the virus, according to two sources familiar with the matter, as the country experiences its largest summer wave in two years.\\n\\nThe agency is expected to greenlight updated mRNA vaccines from Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech that target a strain of the virus called KP.2, said the sources, who declined to be named because the timing information isn’t public. It was unclear whether the agency simultaneously would authorize Novavax’s updated shot, which targets the JN.1 strain.\\n\\nThe move would be several weeks ahead of last year’s version of the vaccine, which got FDA signoff on September 11.\\n\\n“Now is the time to get a dose with this surge,” Dr. Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, told CNN.\\n\\nOsterholm said on his podcast last week that he recently got a dose of last season’s vaccine in order to increase his immunity while the virus is circulating at such high levels and amid uncertainty around when new shots would become available.\\n\\nHe added that he’ll now wait to get the updated one in four months, the interval recommended by health officials.\\n\\nIn June, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended that everyone over 6 months old receive both an updated Covid-19 vaccine and a flu shot this year.\\n\\nRepresentatives for Pfizer and Moderna told CNN that the companies had ample supply of their updated Covid vaccines and would be ready to ship doses upon approval. Moderna’s spokesman said it expects the vaccine to be available in stores within days of FDA signoff.\\n\\nNovavax’s vaccine is based on protein technology, which takes longer to manufacture than mRNA vaccines. The company’s executives told investors on a conference call last week that it anticipated that its updated vaccine would be arriving in warehouses this month and that it’s expected to be ready for distribution when authorized. A spokesperson for Novavax didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment Friday.\\n\\nA spokesperson for the FDA said the agency can’t comment on timing of product applications but noted that it “anticipates taking timely action to authorize or approve updated COVID-19 vaccines in order to make vaccines available this fall.”\\n\\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\\n\\nLevels of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes Covid-19, measured in wastewater are at “very high” levels nationally, according to CDC data, sparking the highest summer peak in the US since July 2022. Monitoring of viral levels in wastewater can give a picture of how widespread the virus is as testing and other forms of monitoring the virus have fallen off.\\n\\nMeasures of severe disease, including rates of hospitalization and death, have been rising, according to the CDC, but they’re nowhere near levels seen in previous years.\\n\\nWaves of the virus are driven by both waning immunity and new variants, experts say. The prevalent strain in the US now is KP.3.1.1, according to CDC data, estimated to account for 37% of cases over the past two weeks. That’s triple its level a month ago.\\n\\nKP.3.1.1 and KP.2 – the strain included in the updated mRNA vaccines – are both offshoots of JN.1, the target of Novavax’s shot, and all are versions of the Omicron variant.\\n\\nCNN’s Brenda Goodman contributed to this report.   \n",

A week ago, competitor Pfizer Inc. announced its own COVID-19 vaccine appeared similarly effective — news that puts both companies on track to seek permission within weeks for emergency use in the U.S.\\n\\nDr. Stephen Hoge, Moderna’s president, welcomed the “really important milestone” but said having similar results from two different companies is what’s most reassuring.\\n\\n“That should give us all hope that actually a vaccine is going to be able to stop this pandemic and hopefully get us back to our lives,” Hoge told The Associated Press.\\n\\n“It won’t be Moderna alone that solves this problem. It’s going to require many vaccines” to meet the global demand, he added.\\n\\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau said in late October that Canada has signed six agreements with a number of companies taking part in the global race to produce a safe and effective vaccine for COVID-19, including Moderna and Pfizer.\\n\\nBoth of those American vaccine makers have asked Health Canada to review their products.\\n\\nA vaccine can’t come fast enough, as case totals in Canada are rapidly approaching the 300,000 mark, even as long-standing national virus hot spots Quebec and Ontario recorded declines in their daily tallies on Sunday.\\n\\nIn the United States, the case total topped 11 million over the weekend — 1 million of them recorded in just the past week. The pandemic has killed more than 1.3 million people worldwide, more than 245,000 of them in the U.S.\\n\\nStill, if the U.S. Food and Drug Administration allows emergency use of Moderna’s or Pfizer’s candidates, there will be limited, rationed supplies before the end of the year. Both require people to get two shots, several weeks apart. Moderna expects to have about 20 million doses, earmarked for the U.S., by the end of 2020. Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech expect to have about 50 million doses globally by year’s end.\\n\\nModerna’s vaccine, created with the National Institutes of Health, is being studied in 30,000 volunteers who received either the real vaccination or a dummy shot. On Sunday, an independent monitoring board broke the code to examine 95 infections that were recorded starting two weeks after volunteers' second dose — and discovered all but five illnesses occurred in participants who got the placebo.\\n\\nThe study is continuing, and Moderna acknowledged the protection rate might change as more COVID-19 infections are detected and added to the calculations. Also, it’s too soon to know how long protection lasts. Both cautions apply to Pfizer’s vaccine as well.\\n\\nBut Moderna’s independent monitors reported some additional, promising tidbits: All 11 severe COVID-19 cases were among placebo recipients, and there were no significant safety concerns.\\n\\nThe main side effects were fatigue, muscle aches and injection-site pain after the vaccine’s second dose, at rates that Hoge characterized as more common than with flu shots but on par with others such as shingles vaccine.   \n",

THE CANADIAN PRESS/Christopher Katsarov”\\n\\nA global technology outage had grounded flights, disrupted hospitals and backed up border crossings in Canada on Friday, as reported issues persisted hours after the issues with Microsoft services were said to be getting fixed.\\n\\nCybersecurity firm CrowdStrike said that the issue believed to be behind the outage was not a security incident or cyberattack. The issue affected Microsoft 365 apps and services, and escalating disruptions continued after the technology company said it was gradually fixing it.\\n\\nToronto Pearson International Airport and Montréal–Trudeau International Airport both said the outage could lead to flight delays and cancellations.\\n\\nPorter Airlines said it is cancelling its flights until 12 p.m. ET due to the outage.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Air Canada said there is no major impact to its operations, adding it is monitoring the situation closely.\\n\\nUniversity Health Network, one of Canada's largest hospital networks, said some of its systems had been impacted by the outage. In a post to social media, it said clinical activity was continuing as scheduled, but some patients may experience delays.\\n\\nWindsor Police reported long delays at both the Canada-United States border crossings at the Ambassador Bridge and the Detroit-Windsor tunnel.\\n\\nThe government of Newfoundland and Labrador said its \"users of its digital platforms\" of possible service disruptions.

Approval may come this week, ahead of last year’s timeline. Experts emphasize the importance of vaccination amid rising cases; the CDC recommends that individuals over six months receive both an updated COVID-19 vaccine and a flu shot. While Moderna and Pfizer are ready to distribute their vaccines quickly upon approval, Novavax's shot will take longer due to its protein-based technology. Monitoring indicates high levels of the virus nationally, though severe disease rates remain lower than in past years.   \n",
       "1  Moderna has announced that its COVID-19 vaccine candidate shows a promising efficacy rate of 94.5%, providing hope amid rising coronavirus cases globally. This follows a similar announcement from Pfizer, leading both companies to seek emergency use authorization in the U.S. in the coming weeks. Despite the positive results from both vaccines, shortages are expected initially, with limited supplies available before the end of 2020. Moderna's vaccine study, involving 30,000 participants, found that severe cases of COVID-19 were only among those given a placebo, and the vaccine side effects were generally mild. The Canadian government is also pursuing agreements with multiple vaccine producers, including Moderna and Pfizer, as COVID-19 cases continue to surge.   \n",

       "3                                          A global technology outage caused by a faulty update from cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike has impacted around 50,000 devices in British Columbia's hospitals, leading staff to revert to paper systems for managing lab work and meal orders. Health Minister Adrian Dix noted that efforts were made to limit the impact on patient care as systems gradually come back online. Although the outage affected hospital operations, it did not disrupt critical services such as the provincial wildfire service or 911. B.C.

      "Resumen: A global technology outage caused significant disruptions in Canada on Friday, grounding flights, impacting hospital services, and delaying border crossings. The issues were linked to Microsoft 365 services, although a cybersecurity firm clarified it was not a cyberattack. Airports like Toronto Pearson and Montréal-Trudeau experienced delays, with Porter Airlines canceling flights until noon ET, while Air Canada reported minimal impact. Some hospitals faced system disruptions, but critical operations continued. Microsoft announced efforts to resolve the issues and indicated improvements in service availability.\n",

      "Resumen: A global technology outage caused by a faulty update from cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike has impacted around 50,000 devices in British Columbia's hospitals, leading staff to revert to paper systems for managing lab work and meal orders. Health Minister Adrian Dix noted that efforts were made to limit the impact on patient care as systems gradually come back online. Although the outage affected hospital operations, it did not disrupt critical services such as the provincial wildfire service or 911. B.C. Premier David Eby indicated that inputting paper records back into electronic health systems would incur extra work for healthcare facilities. Residents are advised not to contact hospital switchboards during this time.\n",

      "URL: https://edition.cnn.com/2024/08/16/health/fda-updated-covid-19-vaccines/index.html\n",
      "Resumen: The US FDA is expected to approve updated COVID-19 vaccines from Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech targeting the KP.2 strain, coinciding with a significant summer wave of infections. Approval may come this week, ahead of last year’s timeline. Experts emphasize the importance of vaccination amid rising cases; the CDC recommends that individuals over six months receive both an updated COVID-19 vaccine and a flu shot. While Moderna and Pfizer are ready to distribute their vaccines quickly upon approval, Novavax's shot will take longer due to its protein-based technology. Monitoring indicates high levels of the virus nationally, though severe disease rates remain lower than in past years.\n",

      "Resumen: Moderna has announced that its COVID-19 vaccine candidate shows a promising efficacy rate of 94.5%, providing hope amid rising coronavirus cases globally. This follows a similar announcement from Pfizer, leading both companies to seek emergency use authorization in the U.S. in the coming weeks. Despite the positive results from both vaccines, shortages are expected initially, with limited supplies available before the end of 2020. Moderna's vaccine study, involving 30,000 participants, found that severe cases of COVID-19 were only among those given a placebo, and the vaccine side effects were generally mild. The Canadian government is also pursuing agreements with multiple vaccine producers, including Moderna and Pfizer, as COVID-19 cases continue to surge.\n",
